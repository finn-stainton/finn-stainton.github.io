!!! info "Status"
    Archived. This was part of *Contemporary Issues in Software Engineering* paper where I gained a B+ grade.

## Aim

The aim of this project was to gain practical use of tools, methods and languages which are actively used in the Software Engineer industry.

## Agile

### Scrum

#### Sprint 0 including Product Discovery

Contacted by the "Product Owner" (Lecturer) to develop a Software Engineering Evidence Repository. We were given a product brief which contained the motivation, outline of input and output (search) processes including some whiteboard screen ideas.

##### User Stories

I then started creating user stories with the "AS A [user of function], I WANT [functionality], SO THAT [benefit to user]"

#### Standup Meetings

**Examples**

"Yesterday I learnt about connecting to MongoDB. Today I will work on connecting CRUD API endpoints to the DB. Nothing is blocking me."

"Yesterday I worked on evidence models which I have pushed to 'finns-api' branch. Today I;m going to work on enabling the api to sort evidence. Nothing is blocking me."
