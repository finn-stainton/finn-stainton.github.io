# Projects

This section contains a mixture of Personal and University Projects, Experiments, Labs, Repairs, Tutorials and Teardowns.

The main aim is to record learnings  throughout the lifespan of the project with other recordings being anywhere from ideas to write ups, project management to developer logs and everything inbetween.
