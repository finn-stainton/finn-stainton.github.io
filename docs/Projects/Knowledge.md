!!! warning

    Rough Idea Ahead

A topic based personal knowledge repository which stores information in LaTex notebook. Notes are stored in a tree structure. Content is retrieved by search or navigating the topic tree.
 
Actionable Knowledge Base

An iPad app would be great, along with desktop. 

Sound similar to Wikipedia, or like a personal encyclopaedia?

Q + A || Q + !A
- Q: Should it be a website or OS App - A: Should be completely local, but can have shared remote repos
- Q: Implications around copyright material - A: Only allow one copy open at a time, what about devices that are offline?

Should be mainly user driven(notes) but formulae and textâ€™s (books, papers, exams) can be imported and stored in a library system
The note dynamically link to resources needed(formulae) 
Should use new or existing folder system (e.g. Import or share OneDrive location)
System imports folders and files into hierarchy (tree)
Should create(or find) a main notebook file for each folder
 
Courses 
	Reading
	Lectures
	Tutorial
	Weekly Quiz
	- Should motivate students with a scoreboard.
	- Latex and wysiwyg final driven development

Ideas
- Could have a section for formula learnt.
- Could be based off OneNote/Evernote
- No folders, only groups of files by tags
- Content should be stored in a compressed file
- Excerpts from multiple sources are inserted to a common idea 
- Content is automatically added by importing a document 

User Stories 
- User shall be able to add a bookmarks
- Lecturers should be able to create tutorials which are interactive and have scoring
    - The student shall be able to write/ draw their answer for each question. 



New 

Inspration

- Obsidian
- Mkdocs
- Jupyter Notes
- Internet Search Engines (Google, DuckDuckGo)
- VS Code (Extensions)



I concluded that a knowledge base should be searchable, 

**Why are my notes public?**

Mainly platform. I have searched 

No hardcoded application gives the freedom of creatively as a website. From the design


File-based applications fail to carry a heretical flow, all files are the one and the same. 

Applications like notion fail with there search engine.

Why has Google been so successful? Retrieval of information is one of, if not the most important aspect of stored information. 

**Are there limits with this system?**

Yes, I would like a editable WYSIWYG

Writing is the process of thinking, getting one's thought's out of their brain so that a larger picture can be seen, understood and acted upon. 

I would like to create diagrams/ sketches more easily

**What do I like about the current system?**

Being able (able being the key word) to see other peoples space.
