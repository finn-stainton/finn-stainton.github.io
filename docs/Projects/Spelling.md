# Spelling App

## Proposal

An phone and tablet app for self-learning of spelling using sound. 

- Allow learners of a language to hear a word or phrase and attempt to spell said word or phrase - Receive feedback on said attempt until they enter a correct spelling
- Completed attempts are repeated depending on how confident a learner feels at spelling said attempt (Spaced Repetition)
- Daily/ Weekly challenges
- Split word up into syllables
- Different levels of testing
    - Fill in the restâ€¦
- Pick words to learn
- Pre-compiled lists
    - Categories
        - e.g. Human anatomy
        - Need to expose people to new words
            - Test students understanding of its meaning
            - e.g. Students write a sentence and then shown a hidden answer
    - Veering levels of difficulty
- Block styling

### Spelling Books

- Users may create group spelling books for multiple users
- Users may create personal, shared spelling books
- Spelling books have Read and Edit permissions
- Users may subscribe to public spelling books
- Curated spelling books (May allow users to create public spelling books, but would have to be moderated/ Reviewed due to the young age of the target Audience)


### Use

1. Learner picks spelling book
2. "Play button appears with text box"
3. Learner presses play button
4. "First word is spoken"
5. Learner types attempt
6. Learner submits
7. "Letters in correct position are lit green, correct letters in the wrong position are lit yellow, wrong letters are not lit". "New textbox below feedback"
8. Attempt/ Feedback loops until correct word entered (or skips after four failed attempts, correct answer shown)
