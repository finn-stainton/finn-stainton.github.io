# Sony S-AIR Wireless Amplifier

I came across this Sony S-AIR Amplifier while at the local waste recycling shop and thought it may be of interest. I had never heard of "S-AIR" before so was intrigued. 

## External

Taking a look at the device it is 205mm wide by 210mm deep and 55mm tall. It has a single tactic power button on the front with what is labeled as "S-AIR/STANDBY" LED indicator. On the rear, it is labeled as Model No. TA-SA200WR, Surround Amplifier. It has two labeled section, the first being "S-AIR ID" which has a three way slide switch with A, B and C positions. It also has a PAIRING button with associated LED. The second section has a "speakers" label which has Left and Right two pin connectors which can support 3-16 ohm impedance speakers.  There is also a two way slide switch which controls the surround position (surround or rear).
