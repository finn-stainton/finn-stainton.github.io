# Flinder (Flatmate Finder React App)

Flinder was a social media app that I helped develop as part of a university project for a Software Development Practice paper of which I gained an A- grade. The aim of Flinder was to helps prospecting flatmates to find their ideal flat based on their personality and living preferences. Have a read below of what I learnt during the project, then check out the [code](https://www.github.com/finn-stainton/flinder)

## Project Proposal

Flinder is a social media app that helps you find your ideal flatmate based on their personality and living preferences. Either you can be a findee (a person who looks for a flat to stay in), or a finder (a person looking for a flatmate to fill in the spot). 

**Key features**:

- User profile: the user profile is different between a finder and findee. Finder presents what the house looks like, as well as some key features, preferences about the place and the flatmates staying there, while findee has to provide their basic information (name, age, profession, smoking habits)
- Chatbox
- Like â™¥ / Nope  
- Match: both finder and findee like each other
- Push notification: nofity people when they get new matches/messages
- Reveal location:  After talking for a while and the finder finds that the findee could be a great fit for the flat, they will reveal the exact address for the findee to arrange a flat viewing.

## Sprint 0 (Up-skilling)

Setup a Scrum Board with the following columns

- Product Backlog
- Sprint One Backlog
- Sprint One Development
- Sprint One Testing
- Sprint One Done
- Sprint Two ...

Developed User Stories using the "As a X, I want to ..., so that ..." format placing them under the product backlog. Then completed INVEST analysis on each user story to judge the quality of each story. Created multiple acceptance tests with a title, then using the "GIVEN that ..., WHEN ..., THEN ..." format.

## Sprint 1

### Planning

Sprint Goal was to "develop an app which lets users list/ find a flat/ flatmate". Then when through the product backlog selecting all user stories needed to complete the sprint goal.

### Execution

I selected to setup the API skelton, which involved

Completed multiple daily standup meetings with the "Yesterday I ..., Today I will ..., What's blocking me is ...".

### Review

### Retrospective
