# 6502 Breadboard Computer

Initiated from [Ben Eater's Design](https://eater.net/6502), I decided to get into computer design by physically recreating it and learning the theory along the way.

6502 Computer without EEPROM

## EEPROM Programmer

Ben Eater used an Uno with 2 74' Shift registers. I didn't have any on hand, but the reason for the shift registers was due to the lack of digital outputs on the Uno. I did have a Mega on hand which has many more outputs. 

Found this code: [GitHub - crmaykish/AT28C-EEPROM-Programmer-Arduino: Programming the AT28C64B or AT28C256 EEPROM chip with an Arduino Mega](https://github.com/crmaykish/AT28C-EEPROM-Programmer-Arduino)

Which uses a Arduino Mega but found connecting all leads to be a waste of time.
