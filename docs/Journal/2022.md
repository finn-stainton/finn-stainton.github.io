## New Knowledge Section, Feb 2022

I recently discovered [ACM Computer Science and Engineering Curricula](https://www.acm.org/education/curricula-recommendations) while looking for an outline of computer science. 

Since high school I have seen the need for new knowledge to build upon pervious. This became more apparent during university where each paper build on previous more heavy. Recording of knowledge to quickly remember the what (as in a glossary), the who, when, where and why(wiki) and the how (tutorial) of subjects. During research, I found the zettailcaste method. This would be useful as recording new thoughts on a (multiple) topics could be combined to speed up reports.

Aims of recording are to assist in my desire to learn and track progress. Articles are both the teacher and student. Articles could use the Feynman Technique

1. Choose a Topic and conduct research on a it
2. Explain the topic as if your teaching someone else
3. Review to identify unknown or poorly known areas
4. Review to identify overly technical explanations
