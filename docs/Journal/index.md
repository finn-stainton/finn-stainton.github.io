## ðŸ“Œ Graduated ðŸŽ‰, Dec 20, 2021

Graduated from AUT with a Bachelor of Computer & Information Sciences, Double Major in Computer Science and Software Development. 

The papers I enjoyed the most were the "hands on" development like Software Development Practice, where our team created a Full-Stack React app for people to find flats and flatmates, [check it out here](https://github.com/SDP-Flinder/flinder)

Here is a table of the skills I learnt from each paper.
