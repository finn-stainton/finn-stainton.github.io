I recently discovered [ACM Computer Science and Engineering Curricula](https://www.acm.org/education/curricula-recommendations) while looking for an outline of computer science. It provides a great wide ranging and detailed base which I will use as a launchpad to record my  learnings from university and new work and independent learnings

I have been looking at improving my web page for a while now. I was looking at using Gatsby, which does look good, but there portfolio and blog templates always included a little too many features which weren't easy to remove. I enjoy the simplistic of markdown, and elegance of Material UI so combining them with [Material for Mkdocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) was a no-brainer.

I came across this Sony S-AIR Amplifier while at the local waste recycling shop and thought it may be of interest. I had never heard of "S-AIR" before so was intrigued.
