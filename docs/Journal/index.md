## New Website, Nov 7, 2021

I have been looking at improving my web page for a while now. I was looking at gatsby, which does look good, there portfolio and blog templates always included a little too many features which weren't easy to remove. I also enjoy the simplistic of markdown, and elegance of Material UI so combining them with [Material for mkdocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) was a no brainer.
