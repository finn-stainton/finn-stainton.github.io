# Circuit Theory

1. Understand the fundamental concepts of circuit theorems applicable to DC and AC circuits.
2. Formulate theory of operational amplifier (Op amp) characteristics, Laplace equivalent of a linear circuit, frequency domain representation for electric circuits using first principles.
3. Participate in problem solving using the circuit theorems, Op amps, Laplace, and Frequency domain analysis for various circuit designs.
4. Design and analyse circuit models (in laboratory groups) to achieve a given specification or to validate a given hypothesis using laboratory test set rigs.
5. Apply computer CAD tool (such as Microcap) to model circuits (linear and nonlinear) with varying levels of fidelity.
6. Analyse trade-offs between performance, sustainability, reliability, and costs of electric circuits.
