# Knowledge

Welcome to my knowledge base[^1]. This is a collection of my readings and learnings of subjects I am interested in. It is aimed as a personal wiki/ second brain and is not intended to be a primary source.

!!! note  ""
    As you may see, it's a wee bit sparse around here. This will change over the coming months. See you around ðŸ‘‹. 

[^1]: Entries may be incomplete, I may not have completed an entry or covered all material on the subject matter in an entry. An empty entry shows my intention of learning/ writing about a subject.
