# Knowledge

Welcome to my knowledge base[^1]. This is a collection of my readings and learnings from areas I am intrested in. It is meant to be an easy "*one stop shop*" to remember the what, where, when, why, who and how. 

!!! note  ""
    As you may see, it's a wee bit sparse around here. This will change over the coming months. See you around ðŸ‘‹.
