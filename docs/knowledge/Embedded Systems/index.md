# Embedded Systems

This paper covers digital signal processing and object-oriented programming in embedded systems. It includes fundamental concepts of digital signal processing, hardware and software design of microcontroller based embedded digital systems, object-oriented programming to develop embedded digital systems with a graphical user interface.

1. Determine the input/output signals of an embedded digital systems.
2. Analyse the hardware and software of a microcontroller-based embedded system.
3. the stability and energy consumption issue of an embedded system.
4. Describe the principles of object-oriented programming.
5. Design a graphical user interface for an embedded digital system
6. Develop an embedded digital system based on a given engineering program specification.
