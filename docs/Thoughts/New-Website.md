# New Website

I have been looking at improving my web page for a while now. I was looking at gatsby, which do look good, there portfolio and blog templates always included a little to many features which weren't easy to remove. I also enjoy the simplistic of markdown, and elegance of material ui so combined them with choosing [Material for mkdocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).
