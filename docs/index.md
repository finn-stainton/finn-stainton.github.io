# Welcome

Hi There! I'm Finn Stainton and you have some how landed in my working notes, ramblings, ideas and half complete project write ups. This website is inspired by   *working with the garage door up*, mentality of being open with my current problems I'm pondering.

This site is broken up into four categories, being

1. [Knowledge](https://finn-stainton.github.io/knowledge), which are my attempt to  categorise learnings from university, books, videos and hands on work of a specific area.
2. [Projects](https://finn-stainton.github.io/projects), which are write ups of personal projects
3. [Notes](https://finn-stainton.github.io/Notes), which are working notes on ideas/ problems, articles and general happenings
4. [Misc](https://finn-stainton.github.io/misc), which as the name implies, don't fit else where. They are mainly tear downs, repairs and reviews.
