# Welcome

Hi There! I'm Finn Stainton and you have some how landed in my second brain, working notes, ideas and unfinished project write ups. This website is inspired by   *working with the garage door up*, mentality of being open with my current problems I'm pondering.

This site has three main categories, being: [Projects](https://finn-stainton.github.io/Projects), [Second Brain](https://finn-stainton.github.io/Second-Brain) and [Blog](https://finn-stainton.github.io/Blog)
