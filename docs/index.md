# Hello, World

I'm Finn Stainton and welcome to my project write ups (on-going), working notes, ideas, happenings and knowledge (current and ambition). This website is inspired by *working with the garage door up* mentality of being open with the current state of projects, knowledge and problems I'm pondering.

Check out some of my projects but just a warning, these are new (so incomplete) write ups. Enjoy.
