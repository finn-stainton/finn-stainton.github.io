# Welcome

Hi There! I'm Finn Stainton and you have some how landed in my second brain, working notes, ideas and unfinished project write ups. This website is inspired by   *working with the garage door up*, mentality of being open with my current problems I'm pondering.

This site has three main categories, being:

## [Projects](https://finn-stainton.github.io/Projects)
Which is anywhere in the project lifecycle from ideas to write ups, project management to developer logs and everything inbetween of personal projects.

!!! note

    Posting notes to each project page is behid due to this webpage being new.

## [Second Brain](https://finn-stainton.github.io/Second-Brain)
Which is a collection of my learnings and discoveries of subjects I am interested in. It is aimed as a personal wiki/ knowledge base and is not intended to be a primary source. The best way to find content is to use the search bar above.

!!! warning  "FYI"

    Content in the Second Brain lags behid my current knowledge. Entries in the Second Brain may be incomplete, non-existent (currently) or they don't cover all material on a subject matter in an entry. An empty entry shows my intention of learning/ writing about a subject.  
   
## [Thoughts](https://finn-stainton.github.io/Thoughts)
Which are working notes on ideas/ problems, articles and general happenings.
