??? info "Learning Outcomes"

    1. Identify the proof technique used in a given proof. [Familiarity]
    2. Outline the basic structure of each proof technique (direct proof, proof by contradiction, and induction)
    described in this unit. [Usage]
    3. Apply each of the proof techniques (direct proof, proof by contradiction, and induction) correctly in the
    construction of a sound argument. [Usage]
    4. Determine which type of proof is best for a given problem. [Assessment]
    5. Explain the parallels between ideas of mathematical and/or structural induction to recursion and recursively
    defined structures. [Assessment]
    6. Explain the relationship between weak and strong induction and give examples of the appropriate use of
    each. [Assessment]
    1. State the well-ordering principle and its relationship to mathematical induction. [Familiarity]
