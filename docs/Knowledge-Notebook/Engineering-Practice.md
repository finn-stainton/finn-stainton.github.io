### Teach Issues

- safety in all laboratories, especially where electronic equipment and electricity pose dangers
- proper use of computers and test equipment
- building electrical and electronic circuits and systems
- building and testing software
- understanding processes and issues associated with product development and manufacturing
- recognizing opportunities for trade-offs (such as hardware, software, off-the-shelf IP, time/space, power, modularity, modifiability, security, and efficiency) and being able to make informed decisions in this area

### Suggestions for possible software applications

**Design modeling and simulation**

- Circuit-level (e.g., SPICE)
- Gate-level (schematic entry)
- Digital systems (e.g., VHDL, Verilog)
- Analog/mixed-signal circuits (e.g., VHDL-AMS, Verilog-AMS)
- System-level design (e.g., System Verilog, System C)

**Digital hardware prototyping**

- FPGA/CPLD development suite
- Design file entry and management - Component/IP library support
- Device programming
- Interactive debugging

**Microcontroller system design**

- Integrateddevelopment environment (IDE)
    - Design entry/management
    - Library support
- Compilers, assemblers, linkers
- Processor simulators/emulators - Device programming
- In-circuit test/debug

**Mathematics packages**
