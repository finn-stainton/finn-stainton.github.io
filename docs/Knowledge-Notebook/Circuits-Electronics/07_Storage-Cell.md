??? info "Learning Outcomes"

    1. Contrast the circuit properties of implementations of various storage elements (e.g., latches, flip-flops, clocked registers).
    2. Contrast the circuit properties of implementations of various memory cells (e.g., static RAM, dynamic RAM, ROM) and related circuitry (e.g., sense amplifiers).
    3. Contrast storage elements and memory cells, emphasizing the tradeoffs that make each appropriate for specific uses.
    4. Contrast the circuit properties of different kinds of non-volatile storage elements (e.g., flash memory, ROM).
    5. Derive timing diagrams showing the relationships among input, output, and clock signals for different storage devices.
