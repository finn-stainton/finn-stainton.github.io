??? info "Learning outcomes"

    - Articulate differences between software and hardware engineering, and computer systems engineering.
    - Explain briefly the concept of a system and a subsystem, and discuss the role of people, the different disciplines involved, and the need for interdisciplinary approaches to the development of the range of computer-based systems.
    - Indicate some important elements of computer systems engineering such as design processes, requirements, specifications, design, testing, validation, evolution, project management, hardware-software interface, and the human-computer interface.
    - Define and explain product life cycle, the role of system engineering throughout a product life cycle, and reasons why many computer- based system designs become continually evolving systems.
    - Provide reasons for the importance of testing, validation, and maintenance in computer systems development.
    - Explain the importance of design decisions and tradeoffs at the systems level, including balancing costs, performance, power, dependability, and market considerations.
