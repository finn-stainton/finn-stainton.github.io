??? info "Learning outcomes"

    - Discuss the relationship and differences between system specifications and requirements.
    - Articulate some typical functional and nonfunctional specifications for the design of a computer-based system and the importance of
      specifications to the design process.
    - Discuss one or more approaches for deriving system specifications from a requirements document.
    - Discuss how tradeoffs between different system specifications might be necessary to meet system requirements.
    - Assess the quality of a given specification, considering such factors as completeness, consistency, simplicity, verifiability, basis for design, specification in the event of failure, and degraded modes of operation.
    - Given a set of requirements, create a high-quality specification for a computer-based system of medium complexity.
    - Create a test plan, based on the specification, considering the role of independence in relation to test, safety cases, and limitations of such tests.
    - Describe and demonstrate the use of one or more formal specification languages and techniques.
    - Translate into natural language a system specification written in a commonly used formal specification language.
