??? info "Learning outcomes"

    - Recognize the range of testing and validation methods appropriate for each stage of the system life cycle, including review of hardware models and software code; white box, black box, and regression testing; stress testing; and interface testing.
    - Describe the role of various system validation tools and show how tools can support efficient and effective development.
    - Discuss approaches to testing and validation at the unit level and at the integration and system levels.
    - Create a test plan and generate test cases for a computer-based system of medium complexity, selecting an appropriate combination of tests for ensuring system quality.
    - Demonstrate the application of the different types and levels of testing (unit, integration, systems, and acceptance) on computer-based systems of medium size.
    - Undertake, as part of a team activity, an inspection of a medium-size computer-based system design.
    - Discuss methods used for manufacturing test and inspection, and acceptance testing.
    Elective Learning Objectives:
    - Discuss methods for specialized testing: security, dependability/fault tolerance, and usability.
