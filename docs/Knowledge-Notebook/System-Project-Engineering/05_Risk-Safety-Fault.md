??? info "Learning outcomes"

    - Recognize risk, dependability, and safety requirements for a range of computer-based systems, and discuss potential tradeoffs between these and other system requirements, such as performance and low-power operation.
    - Explain the concepts of reliability, availability, and maintainability, as measures of system dependability, and explain their relationship to faults.
    - Perform a risk analysis of a medium-size computer-based system.
    - Identify at least two tradeoff concerns when developing a safety critical system.
    - Indicate why it is important to know how to build dependable systems from unreliable components.
    - Demonstrate an ability to model reliability, availability, and maintainability of simple computer-based systems.
    - Describe some strategies for achieving desired levels of dependability, safety, and security.
    - Discuss the nature of hardware and software faults, and redundancy methods used to tolerate them.
    - Describe fault tolerance and dependability requirements of different applications (such as database, aerospace, telecommunications, industrial control, and transaction processing).
    - Describe one or more strategies for risk reduction and risk control, including implications for implementation.
    - Discuss how international standards, legal requirements, and regulations relate to risk, safety and dependability impact the design of computer-based systems. 2 User experience (UX) was formerly known as human-computer interaction (HCI)
    - Discuss the use of failure modes and effects analysis (FEMA) and fault tree analysis in the design of high-integrity systems.
    - Identify some hardware redundancy approaches for fault-tolerant system design, including the use of error detecting and correcting
      codes.
    - Discuss one or more software approaches to tolerating hardware faults.
    - Describe one or more methods for tolerating software faults, such as N-version programming, recovery blocks, and rollback and recovery
