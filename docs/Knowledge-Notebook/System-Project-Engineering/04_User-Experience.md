??? info "Learning outcomes"

    - Define the meaning of user experience (UX) and describe the evolution from human factors to user experience design (UXD).
    - Contrast the physical and non-physical aspects of UXD.
    - Summarize some common human-computer interaction styles, and discuss how one would analyze human interaction with computer-based systems.
    - Describe common usability guidelines and standards; give examples of functional and usability requirements that can be beneficial in developing human-centered computer systems, including users with different abilities (e.g., age, physical disabilities).
    - Identify fundamental principles for effective GUI design, relevant to different applications and different system platforms in computer engineering.
    - Discuss tradeoffs involved when developing a UX system environment.
    - Identify system components that are suitable for the realization of high-quality multimedia interfaces.
    - Evaluate an existing interactive system with appropriate human-centered criteria and usability, giving reasons for selection of criteria and techniques.
    - Discuss the role of visualization technologies in human-computer interaction.
    - Explain the importance of social psychology in the design of user interfaces.
    - Describe two main principles for universal design.
    - List advantages and disadvantages of biometric access control.
    - Describe a possible interface that allows a user with severe physical disabilities to use a website.
    - Design, prototype, and conduct a usability test of a simple 2D GUI, using a provided GUI-builder, and, in doing so, create an appropriate usability test plan.
    - Discuss other techniques for interaction, such as command line interface and shell scripts.
    - Identify the potential for the use of intelligent systems in a range of computer-based applications, and describe situations in which intelligent systems may, or may not, be reliable enough to deliver a required response.
