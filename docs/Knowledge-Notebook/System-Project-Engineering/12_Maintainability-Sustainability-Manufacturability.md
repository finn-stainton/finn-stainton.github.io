??? info "Learning outcomes"

      - Describe the need for, and characteristics of, maintainable software, hardware, and system designs.
      - Discuss the inevitability of maintenance in certain systems, such as diagnosis, defect removal, hardware and/or software upgrades, and enhancement.
      - Describe how to apply principles of maintainable design to a computer-based system of modest complexity.
      - Identify issues associated with system evolution and explain their impact on the system life cycle.
      - Explain configuration management and version control in engineering systemsâ€”the need for it, the issues associated with it, the nature of the information to be held, legal requirements, and planning for possible disasters.
      - Develop a plan for reengineering a medium-size product in response to a change request.
      - Identify and exploit opportunities for component reuse in a variety of contexts.
      - Discuss how design decisions can affect future generations, including impact on the environment and energy resources, and disposal of systems and components at end of life.
      - Discuss design for manufacturability, part selection and standardization, manufacturing cost, and product lead-time for delivery
