??? info "Learning outcomes"

    - Recognize the potential of hardware-software co-design in circumstances in which this approach is pertinent.
    - Discuss how particular design constraints can make the coordinated development of both hardware and software important, such as in
    the design of low-power systems, real-time systems, or systems with high-performance requirements.
    - Apply hardware-software co-design principles in situations of modest complexity.
    - Discuss challenges to effective hardware-software co-design, such as demands of hard real-time features.
    - Demonstrate ability to co-design to achieve specific technical objectives, such as low power, real-time operation, and high
    performance.
    - Select and apply computer-aided tools to support hardware and software co-design.
