??? info "Learning outcomes"

    - Describe concepts and principles of system architecture design, such as top-down design, subdivision into systems and subsystems, modularity and reuse, the hardware/software interface, and tradeoffs between various design options.
    - Describe strengths and weaknesses of various systems-level architectural design methods, including procedural and functional methods.
    - Describe design methods to meet system specifications and achieve performance measures, including dependability and safety.
    - Given a system specification, select an appropriate design methodology (e.g., structured design or modular design) and create an architectural design for a medium-size computer-based system.
    - Demonstrate ability to model, simulate, and prototype a range of computer-based system architectures.
    - Using appropriate guidelines, conduct the review of one or more computer-based system designs to evaluate design quality based on key design principles and concepts.
    - At the architectural level, discuss possible failure modes, common cause failures, dealing with failure, inclusion of diagnostics in the
    event of failure, and approaches to fault-tolerant design.
    - Discuss design issues associated with achieving dependability, the role of redundancy, independence of designs, separation of concerns, and specifications of subsystems.
