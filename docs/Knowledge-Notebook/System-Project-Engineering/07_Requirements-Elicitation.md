??? info "Learning outcomes"

- Perform an analysis of a proposed computer-based system design project, including identification of need, information gathering, problem definition, feasibility considerations, and economic considerations.
- Articulate a range of functional and non-functional requirements that might be applicable to the design of computer-based systems for a range of applications, and discuss how requirements can change as a system design project evolves.
- Discuss how tradeoffs between different system requirements might be necessary for a proposed computer-based system design.
- Describe the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches to requirements elicitation and capture.
- Apply one or more techniques for elicitation and analysis to produce a set of requirements for a medium-size computer-based system.
- Describe some quality factors for measuring the ability of a system design to meet requirements
- Conduct a review of a computer-based system requirements document using best practices to determine the document’s quality.
- Use a common, non-formal method to model and state—in the form of a requirements specification document—the requirements for a medium-size computer-based system (e.g., structured analysis or object-oriented-analysis).
