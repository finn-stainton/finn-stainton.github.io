    - Select, with justification, an appropriate set of tools to support the development of a range of computer-based systems, including tools for project management, requirements and specifications definition and analysis, configuration management, tradeoff analysis, and computer-aided tools for software, hardware, and systems design, including modeling, simulation, evaluation, and testing.
    - Analyze and evaluate a set of tools in an area of computer system development (e.g., management, modeling, or testing).
    - Demonstrate the ability to use a range of tools to support the development of a computer-based system of medium size. (This could be done in the context of a class project or assignment.)
    - Explain the importance and influence of standards, guidelines, legislation, regulations, and professional issues on the development of computer-based systems.
    - Describe tradeoffs that occur in following regulatory standards and regulations.
