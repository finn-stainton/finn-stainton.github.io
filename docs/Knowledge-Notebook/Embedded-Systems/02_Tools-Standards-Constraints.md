??? info "Learning Outcomes"

    1. Use an integrated development environment (IDE) to write, compile and/or assemble, and debug a program (high-level or assembly language) for a target embedded system.
    2. Contrast instrumentation choices for diagnosing/understanding hardware aspects of embedded systems behavior.
    3. List several standards applicable to embedded such as signaling levels and serial communication protocols.

## Tools

### [STM32 Cube IDE]

### [MPX LAB]

## Instrumentation choices for diagnosing

Contrast. Understanding hardware aspects of embedded systems behavior.

## Standards

### Signaling Levels

#### 3.3 volt
#### 5 volt

### Overview of Serial Communication Protocols

#### [I2C](06_Serial-IO/#i2c)

#### [SPI](06_Serial-IO/#spi)
