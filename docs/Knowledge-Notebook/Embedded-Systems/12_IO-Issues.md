??? info "Learning Outcomes"

    1. Discuss concepts used in I/O buses such as master/slave devices, arbitration, transactions, priorities, and packets.
    2. Contrast single-ended signaling versus differential signaling for use in high-speed serial busses, and methods for measuring differential signaling quality such as eye-diagrams.
    3. Describe features such as topology, signaling levels, arbitration, speed, packet structure, and data transfers for one or more advanced serial bus protocols such as the Controller Area Network, Universal Serial Bus, and IEEE 1394 (FireWire).
    4. Discuss architectures and applications of persistent storage for embedded systems, such as flash drives, SD cards, and FRAM.

## Concepts of I/O buses

- master/slave devices 
- arbitration
- transactions
- priorities
- packets

## Single-ended signalling versus differential signalling

### high-speed serial busses, and

### methods for measuring differential signalling quality

- eye-diagrams.

## Features of advanced serial bus protocols

### Controller Area Network (CAN bus)

Developed by Bosch in the early 80's is a two wire multi-master serial bus

**Topology**

Message based multiplex 

**Signalling levels**

It is a two-wire differential

**Arbitration**

**Speed**

**Packet structure**

Frames are received by all devices, including by the transmitting device.

**Data transfers**

### Universal Serial Bus (USB)

**Topology**

**Signalling levels**

**Arbitration**

**Speed**

**Packet structure**

**Data transfers**

### IEEE 1394 (FireWire)

**Topology**

**Signalling levels**

**Arbitration**

**Speed**

**Packet structure**

**Data transfers** 

## Architectures and applications of persistent storage
