??? info "Learning Outcomes"

    1. Describe the basic features and operation of typical hardware timers used in embedded systems.
    2. Create programs that perform periodic I/O triggered by hardware timer-generated interrupts.
    3. Create programs that measure waveform characteristics such as pulse width and frequency using hardware timers.
    4. Describe applications of pulse width modulation.
    5. Create programs that use pulse width modulation for external device control.
