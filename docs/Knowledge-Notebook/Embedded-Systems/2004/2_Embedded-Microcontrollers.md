??? info "Learning Outcomes"

    1. Understand the CPU in the context of a complete system with I/O and memory.
    2. Understand how the CPU talks to the outside world through devices.
    3. Understand how memory system design (caches, memory management) affect program design and performance.

## Structure of a basic computer system: 

- CPU, 
- memory, 
- I/O devices on a bus

## CPU families used in microcontrollers: 

- 4-bit, 
- 8-bit, 
- 16-32-bit
  
## Basic I/O devices: 

timers/counters, 
GPIO, 
A/D, 
D/A

## Polled I/O vs. interrupt-driven I/O

## Interrupt structures:

- vectored interrupts
- prioritized interrupts

## DMA transfers

## Memory management units

## Memory hierarchies and caches
