??? info "Learning Outcomes"

    1. Determine a language’s place in the Chomsky hierarchy (regular, context-free, recursively enumerable). [Assessment]
    2. Convert among equivalently powerful notations for a language, including among DFAs, NFAs, and regular expressions, and between PDAs and CFGs. [Usage]
    3. Explain the Church-Turing thesis and its significance. [Familiarity]
    4. Explain Rice’s Theorem and its significance. [Familiarity]
    5. Provide examples of uncomputable functions. [Familiarity]
    6. Prove that a problem is uncomputable by reducing a classic known uncomputable problem to it. [Usage]
