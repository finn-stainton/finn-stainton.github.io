??? info "Learning outcomes"

    1. Use formal grammars to specify the syntax of languages. [Usage]
    2. Use declarative tools to generate parsers and scanners. [Usage]
    3. Identify key issues in syntax definitions: ambiguity, associativity, precedence. [Familiarity]

## Scanning (lexical analysis) using regular expressions

## Parsing strategies

### top-down

#### recursive descent

#### Earley parsing

#### LL

### bottom-up

#### backtracking

#### LR

### Role of context-free grammars

## Generating scanners and parsers from declarative specifications
