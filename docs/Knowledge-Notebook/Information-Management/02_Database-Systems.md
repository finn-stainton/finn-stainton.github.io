    1. Explain the characteristics that distinguish the database approach from the approach of programming with data files. [Familiarity]
    2. Describe the most common designs for core database system components including the query optimizer, query executor, storage manager, access methods, and transaction processor. [Familiarity]
    3. Cite the basic goals, functions, and models of database systems. [Familiarity]
    4. Describe the components of a database system and give examples of their use. [Familiarity]
    5. Identify major DBMS functions and describe their role in a database system. [Familiarity]
    6. Explain the concept of data independence and its importance in a database system. [Familiarity]
    7. Use a declarative query language to elicit information from a database. [Usage]
    8. Describe facilities that datatbases provide supporting structures and/or stream (sequence) data, e.g., text. [Familiarity]
    9. Describe major approaches to storing and processing large volumes of data. [Familiarity]
