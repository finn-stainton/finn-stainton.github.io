??? info "Learning outcomes"

    1. Explain the techniques used for data fragmentation, replication, and allocation during the distributed
    database design process. [Familiarity]
    1. Evaluate simple strategies for executing a distributed query to select the strategy that minimizes the amount of data transfer. [Assessment]
    2. Explain how the two-phase commit protocol is used to deal with committing a transaction that accesses databases stored on multiple nodes. [Familiarity]
    3. Describe distributed concurrency control based on the distinguished copy techniques and the voting method. [Familiarity]
    4. Describe the three levels of software in the client-server model. [Familiarity]

## Distributed DBMS

### Distributed data storage

### Distributed query processing

### Distributed transaction model

### Homogeneous and heterogeneous solutions

### Client-server distributed databases (cross-reference SF/Computational Paradigms)

## Parallel DBMS

### Parallel DBMS architectures: shared memory, shared disk, shared nothing;

### Speedup and scale-up, e.g., use of the MapReduce processing model 

(cross-reference CN/Processing, PD/Parallel Decomposition)

### Data replication and weak consistency models
