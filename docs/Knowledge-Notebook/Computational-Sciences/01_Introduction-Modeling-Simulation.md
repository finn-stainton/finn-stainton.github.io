# CN/ Introduction to Modeling and Simulation

[:octicons-arrow-left-24: Return to Computational Sciences](/Knowledge-Notebook/Computational-Sciences/)

---

Abstraction is a fundamental concept in computer science. A principal approach to computing is to abstract the real world, create a model that can be simulated on a machine. The roots of computer science can be traced to this approach, modeling things such as trajectories of artillery shells and the modeling cryptographic protocols, both of which pushed the development of early computing systems in the early and mid-1940’s. Modeling and simulation of real world systems represent essential knowledge for computer scientists and provide a foundation for computational sciences. Any introduction to modeling and simulation would either include or presume an introduction to computing. In addition, a general set of modeling and simulation techniques, data visualization methods, and software testing and evaluation mechanisms are also important.

??? info "Learning Outcomes"

    1. Explain the concept of modeling and the use of abstraction that allows the use of a machine to solve a problem. [Familiarity]
    2. Describe the relationship between modeling and simulation, i.e., thinking of simulation as dynamic modeling. [Familiarity]
    3. Create a simple, formal mathematical model of a real-world situation and use that model in a simulation. [Usage]
    4. Differentiate among the different types of simulations, including physical simulations, human-guided simulations, and virtual reality. [Familiarity]
    5. Describe several approaches to validating models. [Familiarity]
    6. Create a simple display of the results of a simulation. [Usage]

## Models as abstractions of situations

## Simulations as dynamic modeling

## Simulation techniques and tools

such as physical simulations, human-in-the-loop guided simulations, and virtual reality

## Foundational approaches to validating models 

(e.g., comparing a simulation’s output to real data or the output of another model)

## Presentation of results in a form relevant to the system being modeled
