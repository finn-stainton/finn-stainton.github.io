The processing topic area includes numerous topics from other knowledge areas. Specifically,
coverage of processing should include a discussion of hardware architectures, including parallel
systems, memory hierarchies, and interconnections among processors. These are covered in
AR/Interfacing and Communication, AR/Multiprocessing and Alternative Architectures,
AR/Performance Enhancements.

## Fundamental programming concepts:

- The concept of an algorithm consisting of a finite number of well-defined steps, each of which completes in a finite amount of time, as does the entire process.
- Examples of well-known algorithms such as sorting and searching.
- The concept of analysis as understanding what the problem is really asking, how a problem can be approached using an algorithm, and how information is represented so that a machine can process it.
- The development or identification of a workflow.
- The process of converting an algorithm to machine-executable code.
- Software processes including lifecycle models, requirements, design, implementation, verification and maintenance.
- Machine representation of data computer arithmetic.

## Numerical methods

- Algorithms for numerically fitting data (e.g., Newtonâ€™s method)
- Architectures for numerical computation, including parallel architectures

## Fundamental properties of parallel and distributed computation:
