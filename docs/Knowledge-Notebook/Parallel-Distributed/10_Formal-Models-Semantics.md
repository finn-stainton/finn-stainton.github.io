   1. Model a concurrent process using a formal model, such as pi-calculus. [Usage]
   2. Explain the characteristics of a particular formal parallel model. [Familiarity]
   3. Formally model a shared memory system to show if it is consistent. [Usage]
   4. Use a model to show progress guarantees in a parallel algorithm. [Usage]
   5. Use formal techniques to show that a parallel algorithm is correct with respect to a safety or liveness property. [Usage]
   6. Decide if a specific execution is linearizable or not. [Usage]

## Formal models of processes and message passing, including algebras such as Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) and pi-calculus

## Formal models of parallel computation, including the Parallel Random Access Machine (PRAM) and alternatives such as Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP)

## Formal models of computational dependencies

## Models of (relaxed) shared memory consistency and their relation to programming language specifications

## Algorithmic correctness criteria including linearizability

## Models of algorithmic progress, including non-blocking guarantees and fairness

## Techniques for specifying and checking correctness properties such as atomicity and freedom from data races
