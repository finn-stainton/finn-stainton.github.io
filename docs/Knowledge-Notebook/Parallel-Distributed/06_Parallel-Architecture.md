# PD/Parallel Architecture

[:octicons-arrow-left-24: Return to Parallel and Distributed Computing](/Knowledge-Notebook/Parallel-Distributed/)

---

The topics listed here are related to knowledge units in the Architecture and Organization (AR) knowledge area (AR/Assembly Level Machine Organization and AR/Multiprocessing and Alternative Architectures). Here, we focus on parallel architecture from the standpoint of applications, whereas the Architecture and Organization knowledge area presents the topic from the hardware perspective.
