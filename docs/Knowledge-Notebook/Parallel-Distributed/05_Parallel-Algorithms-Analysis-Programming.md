??? info "Learning outcomes"

    1. Define “critical path”, “work”, and “span”. [Familiarity]
    2. Compute the work and span, and determine the critical path with respect to a parallel execution diagram. [Usage]
    3. Define “speed-up” and explain the notion of an algorithm’s scalability in this regard. [Familiarity]
    4. Identify independent tasks in a program that may be parallelized. [Usage]
    5. Characterize features of a workload that allow or prevent it from being naturally parallelized. [Familiarity]
    6. Implement a parallel divide-and-conquer (and/or graph algorithm) and empirically measure its performance
    relative to its sequential analog. [Usage]
    7. Decompose a problem (e.g., counting the number of occurrences of some word in a document) via map and
    reduce operations. [Usage]
    [Elective]
    8. Provide an example of a problem that fits the producer-consumer paradigm. [Familiarity]
    9. Give examples of problems where pipelining would be an effective means of parallelization. [Familiarity]
    10. Implement a parallel matrix algorithm. [Usage]
    11. Identify issues that arise in producer-consumer algorithms and mechanisms that may be used for addressing
    them. [Familiarity]
