??? info "Learning outcomes"

    1. Explain why synchronization is necessary in a specific parallel program. [Usage]
    2. Identify opportunities to partition a serial program into independent parallel modules. [Familiarity]
    3. Write a correct and scalable parallel algorithm. [Usage]
    4. Parallelize an algorithm by applying task-based decomposition. [Usage]
    5. Parallelize an algorithm by applying data-parallel decomposition. [Usage]
    6. Write a program using actors and/or reactive processes. [Usage]

## Need for communication and coordination/synchronization

## Independence and partitioning

## Basic knowledge of parallel decomposition concepts (cross-reference SF/System Support for Parallelism)

## Task-based decomposition

### Implementation strategies such as threads

## Data-parallel decomposition

### Strategies such as SIMD and MapReduce

## Actors and reactive processes (e.g., request handlers)
