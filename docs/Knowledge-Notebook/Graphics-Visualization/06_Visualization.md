Visualization has strong ties to the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) knowledge area as well as Computational Science (CN). Readers should refer to the HCI and CN KAs for additional topics related to user population and interface evaluations.

??? info "Learning outcomes"

    1. Describe the basic algorithms for scalar and vector visualization. [Familiarity]
    2. Describe the tradeoffs of visualization algorithms in terms of accuracy and performance. [Assessment]
    3. Propose a suitable visualization design for a particular combination of data characteristics and application tasks. [Assessment]
    4. Analyze the effectiveness of a given visualization for a particular task. [Assessment]
    5. Design a process to evaluate the utility of a visualization algorithm or system. [Assessment]
    6. Recognize a variety of applications of visualization including representations of scientific, medical, and mathematical data; flow visualization; and spatial analysis. [Familiarity]

## Visualization of 2D/3D scalar fields: color mapping, isosurfaces

## Direct volume data rendering: ray-casting, transfer functions, segmentation

## Visualization of:

### Vector fields and flow data

### Time-varying data

### High-dimensional data: dimension reduction, parallel coordinates,

### Non-spatial data: multi-variate, tree/graph structured, text

## Perceptual and cognitive foundations that drive visual abstractions

## Visualization design

## Evaluation of visualization methods

## Applications of visualization
