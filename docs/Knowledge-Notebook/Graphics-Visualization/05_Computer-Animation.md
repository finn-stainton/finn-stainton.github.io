??? info "Learning outcomes"

    1. Compute the location and orientation of model parts using a forward kinematic approach. [Usage]
    2. Compute the orientation of articulated parts of a model from a location and orientation using an inverse kinematic approach. [Usage]
    3. Describe the tradeoffs in different representations of rotations. [Assessment]
    4. Implement the spline interpolation method for producing in-between positions and orientations. [Usage]
    5. Implement algorithms for physical modeling of particle dynamics using simple Newtonian mechanics, for example Witkin & Kass, snakes and worms, symplectic Euler, Stormer/Verlet, or midpoint Euler methods. [Usage]
    6. Discuss the basic ideas behind some methods for fluid dynamics for modeling ballistic trajectories, for example for splashes, dust, fire, or smoke. [Familiarity]
    7. Use common animation software to construct simple organic forms using metaball and skeleton. [Usage]
