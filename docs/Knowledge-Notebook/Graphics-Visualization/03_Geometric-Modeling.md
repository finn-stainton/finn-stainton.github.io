??? info "Learning outcomes"
    1. Represent curves and surfaces using both implicit and parametric forms. [Usage]
    2. Create simple polyhedral models by surface tessellation. [Usage]
    3. Generate a mesh representation from an implicit surface. [Usage]
    4. Generate a fractal model or terrain using a procedural method. [Usage]
    5. Generate a mesh from data points acquired with a laser scanner. [Usage]
    6. Construct CSG models from simple primitives, such as cubes and quadric surfaces. [Usage]
    7. Contrast modeling approaches with respect to space and time complexity and quality of image.
