??? info "Learning outcomes"
    1. Demonstrate how an algorithm estimates a solution to the rendering equation. [Assessment]
    2. Prove the properties of a rendering algorithm, e.g., complete, consistent, and unbiased. [Assessment]
    3. Analyze the bandwidth and computation demands of a simple algorithm. [Assessment]
    4. Implement a non-trivial shading algorithm (e.g., toon shading, cascaded shadow maps) under a rasterization API. [Usage]
    5. Discuss how a particular artistic technique might be implemented in a renderer. [Familiarity]
    6. Explain how to recognize the graphics techniques used to create a particular image. [Familiarity]
    7. Implement any of the specified graphics techniques using a primitive graphics system at the individual pixel level. [Usage]
    8. Implement a ray tracer for scenes using a simple (e.g., Phong model) BRDF plus reflection and refraction. [Usage]
