Computer graphics is the term commonly used to describe the computer generation and manipulation of images. It is the science of enabling visual communication through computation. Its uses include cartoons, film special effects, video games, medical imaging, engineering, as well as scientific, information, and knowledge visualization. Traditionally, graphics at the undergraduate level has focused on rendering, linear algebra, and phenomenological approaches. More recently, the focus has begun to include physics, numerical integration, scalability, and special-purpose hardware. In order for students to become adept at the use and generation of computer graphics, many implementation-specific issues must be addressed, such as file formats, hardware interfaces, and application program interfaces. These issues change rapidly, and the description that follows attempts to avoid being overly prescriptive about them. The area encompassed by Graphics and Visualization is divided into several interrelated fields:

- **Fundamentals**: Computer graphics depends on an understanding of how humans use
vision to perceive information and how information can be rendered on a display device.
Every computer scientist should have some understanding of where and how graphics can
be appropriately applied as well as the fundamental processes involved in display
rendering.
- **Modeling**: Information to be displayed must be encoded in computer memory in some
form, often in the form of a mathematical specification of shape and form.
- **Rendering**: Rendering is the process of displaying the information contained in a model.
- **Animation**: Animation is the rendering in a manner that makes images appear to move
and the synthesis or acquisition of the time variations of models.
- **Visualization**: The field of visualization seeks to determine and present underlying correlated structures and relationships in data sets from a wide variety of application areas. The prime objective of the presentation should be to communicate the information in a dataset so as to enhance understanding
- **Computational Geometry**: Computational Geometry is the study of algorithms that are
stated in terms of geometry.

Graphics and Visualization is related to machine vision and image processing, which are found in the Intelligent Systems (IS) KA, and algorithms such as computational geometry, which are found in the Algorithms and Complexity (AL) KA. Topics in virtual reality are found in the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) KA. This description assumes students are familiar with fundamental concepts of data representation, abstraction, and program implementation.
