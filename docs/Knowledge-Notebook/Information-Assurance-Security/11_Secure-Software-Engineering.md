??? info "Learning outcomes"

    1. Describe the requirements for integrating security into the software development lifecycle. [Familiarity]
    2. Apply the concepts of the Design Principles for Protection Mechanisms, the Principles for Software Security [2], and the Principles for Secure Design [1] on a software development project. [Usage]
    3. Develop specifications for a software development effort that fully specify functional requirements and identifies the expected execution paths. [Usage]
    4. Describe software development best practices for minimizing vulnerabilities in programming code. [Familiarity]
    5. Conduct a security verification and assessment (static and dynamic) of a software application. [Usage]
