## Basic Cryptography Terminology

covering notions pertaining to the different (communication) partners, secure/unsecure channel, attackers and their capabilities, encryption, decryption, keys and their characteristics, signatures

## Cipher types

(e.g., Caesar cipher, affine cipher) together with typical attack methods such as frequency analysis

## Public Key Infrastructure

support for digital signature and encryption and its challenges

## Mathematical Preliminaries

essential for cryptography, including topics in linear algebra, number theory, probability theory, and statistics

## Cryptographic primitives:

### pseudo-random generators and stream ciphers

### block ciphers (pseudo-random permutations)

, e.g., AES o pseudo-random functions

### hash functions

, e.g., SHA2, collision resistance

### message authentication codes

### key derivations functions

## Symmetric key cryptography

### Perfect secrecy and the one time pad

### Modes of operation for semantic security and authenticated encryption

 (e.g., encrypt-then-MAC, OCB, GCM)

### Message integrity
 (e.g., CMAC, HMAC)

## Public key cryptography

### Trapdoor permutation, e.g., RSA

### Public key encryption, e.g., RSA encryption, EI Gamal encryption o Digital signatures

### Public-key infrastructure (PKI) and certificates

### Hardness assumptions, e.g., Diffie-Hellman, integer factoring

## Authenticated key exchange protocols

, e.g., TLS

## Cryptographic protocols

: challenge-response authentication, zero-knowledge protocols, commitment, oblivious transfer, secure 2-party or multi-party computation, secret sharing, and applications

## Motivate concepts using real-world applications

, e.g., electronic cash, secure channels between clients and servers, secure electronic mail, entity authentication, device pairing, voting systems.

## Security definitions and attacks on cryptographic primitives

### Goals

indistinguishability, unforgeability, collision-resistance

### Attacker capabilities

chosen-message attack (for signatures), birthday attacks, side channel attacks, fault injection attacks.

## Cryptographic standards and references implementations

## Quantum cryptography
