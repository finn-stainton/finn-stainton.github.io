# IAS/Network Security

Discussion of network security relies on previous understanding on fundamental concepts of networking, including protocols, such as TCP/IP, and network architecture/organization (cross-reference NC/Network Communication).

## Network specific threats and attack types

---

(e.g., denial of service, spoofing, sniffing and traffic redirection, man-in-the-middle, message integrity attacks, routing attacks, and traffic analysis)

## Use of cryptography for data and network security

---

## Architectures for secure networks

---

(e.g., secure channels, secure routing protocols, secure DNS, VPNs, anonymous communication protocols, isolation)

## Defense mechanisms and countermeasures

---

(e.g., network monitoring, intrusion detection, firewalls, spoofing and DoS protection, honeypots, tracebacks)

## Security for wireless, cellular networks

---

(cross-reference NC/Mobility/Principles of cellular networks; cross-reference NC/Mobility/802.11)

## Other non-wired networks

---

(e.g., ad hoc, sensor, and vehicular networks)

## Censorship resistance

---

## Operational network security management

---

(e.g., configure network access control)
