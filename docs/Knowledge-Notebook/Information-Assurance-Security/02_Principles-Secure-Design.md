??? info "Learning outcomes"

    1. Describe the principle of least privilege and isolation as applied to system design. [Familiarity]
    2. Summarize the principle of fail-safe and deny-by-default. [Familiarity]
    3. Discuss the implications of relying on open design or the secrecy of design for security. [Familiarity]
    4. Explain the goals of end-to-end data security. [Familiarity]
    5. Discuss the benefits of having multiple layers of defenses. [Familiarity]
    6. For each stage in the lifecycle of a product, describe what security considerations should be evaluated.[Familiarity]
    7. Describe the cost and tradeoffs associated with designing security into a product. [Familiarity]
    8. Describe the concept of mediation and the principle of complete mediation. [Familiarity]
    9. Describe standard components for security operations, and explain the benefits of their use instead of re-inventing fundamentals operations. [Familiarity]
    10. Explain the concept of trusted computing including trusted computing base and attack surface and the principle of minimizing trusted computing base. [Familiarity]
    11. Discuss the importance of usability in security mechanism design. [Familiarity]
    12. Describe security issues that arise at boundaries between multiple components. [Familiarity]
    13. Identify the different roles of prevention mechanisms and detection/deterrence mechanisms. [Familiarity]
