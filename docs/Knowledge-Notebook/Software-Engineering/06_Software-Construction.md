??? info "Learning Outcomes"

    1. Describe techniques, coding idioms and mechanisms for implementing designs to achieve desired
    properties such as reliability, efficiency, and robustness. [Familiarity]
    2. Build robust code using exception handling mechanisms. [Usage]
    3. Describe secure coding and defensive coding practices. [Familiarity]
    4. Select and use a defined coding standard in a small software project. [Usage]
    5. Compare and contrast integration strategies including top-down, bottom-up, and sandwich integration. [Familiarity]
    6. Describe the process of analyzing and implementing changes to code base developed for a specific project. [Familiarity]
    7. Describe the process of analyzing and implementing changes to a large existing code base. [Familiarity]
    8. Rewrite a simple program to remove common vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, integer overflows and race conditions. [Usage]
    9. Write a software component that performs some non-trivial task and is resilient to input and run-time errors. [Usage]

## Coding practices

(cross-reference IAS/Defensive Programming; SDF/Development Methods)

techniques

idioms/patterns,

mechanisms for building quality programs



### Defensive coding practices

### Secure coding practices

### Using exception handling mechanisms to make programs more robust, fault-tolerant

## Coding standards

## Integration strategies

## Development context

“green field” vs. existing code base

### Change impact analysis

### Change actualization

## Potential security problems in programs

### Buffer and other types of overflows

### Race conditions

### Improper initialization

 including choice of privileges

### Checking input

### Assuming success and correctness

### Validating assumptions
