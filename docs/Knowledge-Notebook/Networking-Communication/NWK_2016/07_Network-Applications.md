??? info "Learning Outcomes"

    - Describe the key components of a web solution stack using LAMP (Linux, Apache HTTP server, MySQL, PHP/Perl/Python) or other similar illustrative examples.
    - Explain the different roles and responsibilities of clients and servers for a range of possible applications.
    - Select a range of tools that ensures an efficient approach to implementing various client-server possibilities.
    - Design and build a simple interactive web-based application (for example, a simple web form that collects information from the client
    and stores it in a file on the server).
    - Discuss web software stack technologies such as LAMP solution stack.
    - Explain characteristics of web servers such as handling permissions, file management, and capabilities of common server architectures.
    - Describe support tools for website creation and web management.
    - Describe at a high level, ways in which a wide variety of clients and server software interoperates to provide e-mail services worldwide.
    - Implement solutions using dynamic HTML and client- and server-side models for web applications.
    - Give examples of and state advantages and disadvantages of peer-to-peer models.
    - Explain the principles, advantages, and challenges of cloud computing.
    - Give examples of cloud computing APIs or commercial services and summarize the key abilities they provide.
    - Describe the key components and tradeoffs of a modern network application that requires a hybrid of many areas with computer
    networks such as machine learning, data mining, HCI, and transportation systems.
