??? info "Learning Outcomes"

    - Contrast connection-oriented and connectionless services.
    - Contrast network protocols in dimensions related to their syntax, semantics, and timing.
    - Define the role of key layers from a software stack including physical-layer networking concepts, data-link layer concepts,internetworking, and routing.
    - Explain some common protocol suites and the services they provide (e.g., IPv4, IPv6, and TCP/UDP).
    - Describe the functions of the network layer and networking technology.
    - Contrast different network architectures.
    - Describe the important technologies used in routers.
    - Contrast at least two important routing algorithms.
    - Explain congestion control and contrast its related algorithms.
    - Describe main contents of the IP, TCP and UDP protocols.
    - Explain the role of the Domain Name System (DNS) and the benefits of its distributed design.
