    1. Apply Bayes’ rule to determine the probability of a hypothesis given evidence. [Usage]
    2. Explain how conditional independence assertions allow for greater efficiency of probabilistic systems. [Assessment]
    3. Identify examples of knowledge representations for reasoning under uncertainty. [Familiarity]
    4. State the complexity of exact inference. Identify methods for approximate inference. [Familiarity]
    5. Design and implement at least one knowledge representation for reasoning under uncertainty. [Usage]
    6. Describe the complexities of temporal probabilistic reasoning. [Familiarity]
    7. Design and implement an HMM as one example of a temporal probabilistic system. [Usage]
    8. Describe the relationship between preferences and utility functions. [Familiarity]
    9. Explain how utility functions and probabilistic reasoning can be combined to make rational decisions. [Assessment]
