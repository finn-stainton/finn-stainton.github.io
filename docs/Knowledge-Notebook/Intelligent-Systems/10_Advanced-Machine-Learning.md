??? info "Learning outcomes"

    1. Explain the differences among the three main styles of learning: supervised, reinforcement, and unsupervised. [Familiarity]
    2. Implement simple algorithms for supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and unsupervised learning. [Usage]
    3. Determine which of the three learning styles is appropriate to a particular problem domain. [Usage]
    4. Compare and contrast each of the following techniques, providing examples of when each strategy is superior: decision trees, neural networks, and belief networks. [Assessment]
    5. Evaluate the performance of a simple learning system on a real-world dataset. [Assessment]
    6. Characterize the state of the art in learning theory, including its achievements and its shortcomings. [Familiarity]
    7. Explain the problem of overfitting, along with techniques for detecting and managing the problem. [Usage]
