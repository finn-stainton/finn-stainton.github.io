??? info "Learning outcomes"

    1. Compare and contrast the most common models used for structured knowledge representation, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. [Assessment]
    2. Identify the components of non-monotonic reasoning and its usefulness as a representational mechanism for belief systems. [Familiarity]
    3. Compare and contrast the basic techniques for representing uncertainty. [Assessment]
    4. Compare and contrast the basic techniques for qualitative representation. [Assessment]
    5. Apply situation and event calculus to problems of action and change. [Usage]
    6. Explain the distinction between temporal and spatial reasoning, and how they interrelate. [Familiarity]
    7. Explain the difference between rule-based, case-based and model-based reasoning techniques. [Familiarity]
    8. Define the concept of a planning system and how it differs from classical search techniques. [Familiarity]
    9. Describe the differences between planning as search, operator-based planning, and propositional planning, providing examples of domains where each is most applicable. [Familiarity]
    10. Explain the distinction between monotonic and non-monotonic inference. [Familiarity]
