    1. List the defining characteristics of an intelligent agent. [Familiarity]
    2. Characterize and contrast the standard agent architectures. [Assessment]
    3. Describe the applications of agent theory to domains such as software agents, personal assistants, and believable agents. [Familiarity]
    4. Describe the primary paradigms used by learning agents. [Familiarity]
    5. Demonstrate using appropriate examples how multi-agent systems support agent interaction. [Usage]

## Definitions of agents

## Agent architectures (e.g., reactive, layered, cognitive)

## Agent theory

## Rationality, game theory

### Decision-theoretic agents

### Markov decision processes (MDP)

## Software agents, personal assistants, and information access

### Collaborative agents

### Information-gathering agents

### Believable agents (synthetic characters, modeling emotions in agents)

## Learning agents

## Multi-agent systems

### Collaborating agents

### Agent teams

### Competitive agents (e.g., auctions, voting)

### Swarm systems and biologically inspired models
