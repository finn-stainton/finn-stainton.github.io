    1. Formulate an efficient problem space for a problem expressed in natural language (e.g., English) in terms of initial and goal states, and operators. [Usage]
    2. Describe the role of heuristics and describe the trade-offs among completeness, optimality, time complexity, and space complexity. [Familiarity]
    3. Describe the problem of combinatorial explosion of search space and its consequences. [Familiarity]
    4. Select and implement an appropriate uninformed search algorithm for a problem, and characterize its time and space complexities. [Usage]
    5. Select and implement an appropriate informed search algorithm for a problem by designing the necessary heuristic evaluation function. [Usage]
    6. Evaluate whether a heuristic for a given problem is admissible/can guarantee optimal solution. [Assessment]
    7. Formulate a problem specified in natural language (e.g., English) as a constraint satisfaction problem and implement it using a chronological backtracking algorithm or stochastic local search. [Usage]
    8. Compare and contrast basic search issues with game playing issues. [Familiarity]

## Problem spaces (states, goals and operators), problem solving by search

## Factored representation (factoring state into variables)

## Uninformed search (breadth-first, depth-first, depth-first with iterative deepening)

## Heuristics and informed search (hill-climbing, generic best-first, A*)

## Space and time efficiency of search

## Two-player games (introduction to minimax search)

## Constraint satisfaction (backtracking and local search methods)
