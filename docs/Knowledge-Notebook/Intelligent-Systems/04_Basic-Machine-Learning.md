??? info "Learning outcomes"

    1. List the differences among the three main styles of learning: supervised, reinforcement, and unsupervised. [Familiarity]
    2. Identify examples of classification tasks, including the available input features and output to be predicted. [Familiarity]
    3. Explain the difference between inductive and deductive learning. [Familiarity]
    4. Describe over-fitting in the context of a problem. [Familiarity]
    5. Apply the simple statistical learning algorithm such as Naive Bayesian Classifier to a classification task and measure the classifier's accuracy. [Usage]

## Classification

TODO add Definition and examples of broad variety of machine learning tasks

## Inductive learning

## Simple statistical-based learning, such as Naive Bayesian Classifier, decision trees

## The over-fitting problem

## Measuring classifier accuracy
