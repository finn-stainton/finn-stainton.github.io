??? info "Learning outcomes"

    1. Define and contrast deterministic and stochastic grammars, providing examples to show the adequacy of each. [Assessment]
    2. Simulate, apply, or implement classic and stochastic algorithms for parsing natural language. [Usage]
    3. Identify the challenges of representing meaning. [Familiarity]
    4. List the advantages of using standard corpora. Identify examples of current corpora for a variety of NLP tasks. [Familiarity]
    5. Identify techniques for information retrieval, language translation, and text classification. [Familiarity]

## Deterministic and stochastic grammars
