# Plain English

> NB: Ironically or not, I use bullet points. Not sure if this fits with the Plain English Campaign. I have a lot of faults with my english presentation, but am interested in improving. 

## Design and Layout

### Type shape

- Serif
  
  - With feet (serifs)

- San Serif

- Usually better to use san serif

- Only use one font per document

### Font size

- Measured in 'points'

- Aim for 12 point

- Minimum 10 if pushed for space

- Minimum 14 point for text likely to be read by blind or partially sighted

- Headings should be at least two point sizes bigger than body text

- Avoid block capital letters

- Use **bold** for emphasis

- Don't underline

- Avoid italics

### Line length

- Can affect ease and speed of reading

- Includes spaces

- Normally between 60 to 72 characters, 

- or about 10 to 12 words

### Line spacing (leading)

- Technical term is 'leading' (pronounced 'ledding')

- Uses 'points' measurement

- Body text leading should be greater than the space between words

- Normally for 10- to 12-point body text, leading of 120%

- So, 10-point body text, leading will be 12 points

### Alignment

- Four options
  
  1. justified, where a column is aligned on the left and the right
  
  2. ranged left, also know as ragged right, where text is only aligned on the left
  
  3. ranged right, also know as ragged left, where text is only aligned on the right
  
  4. centred

- Spacing between word varies from line to line when text is **justified**

- With all other alignments, the spacing between words is constant

- Use ranged left for an easier reading experience

- Justified text can look neater, but is harder to read

- Avoid splitting a word, or hyphenated term over two lines

### Graphic elements

- Important to understand how text, illustrations and white space relate to each other

- Pages dense with body text can be off-putting

- Use design to attract readers and help them navigate your document

- Aim for margins of about 25mm at the top, bottom and sides of each page

- Use a clear hierarchy of headings and subheadings using different sizes

- Have a good contrast between the colour of text and the background

- Subheadings should have more space above it than below it to link it to the following text

- Headline and headings need breathing space, Let space frame them

### Professional touches

#### Pull quotes

- Displays an extract from the text prominently, usually is the side margin

- Keep it short and choose a pithy or dramatic extract

- Encourage your reader's curiosity
