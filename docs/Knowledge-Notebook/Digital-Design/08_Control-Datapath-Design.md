# DIG/Control and datapath design

[:octicons-arrow-left-24: Return to Digital Design](/Knowledge-Notebook/Digital-Design/)

??? info "Learning Outcomes"

    1. Describe a digital system that is partitioned into control+datapath and explain the need for control to sequence operations on a datapath.
    2. Contrast the different types of Finite State Machines (FSMs): e.g., Mealy State Machine, Moore State Machine, and Algorithmic State Machine (ASM). 
    3. Represent FSM operation graphically using a state diagram (e.g., Mealy state diagram, Moore state diagram, or ASM chart).
    4. Analyze state diagrams and create timing diagrams for FSM operation.
    5. Compute timing parameters such as maximum operating frequency, setup/hold time of synchronous inputs, clock-to-out propagation delays, pin-to-pin propagate delay for a control+datapath design.
    6. Design an RTL model of a control+datapath using a HDL and synthesize/verify using appropriate design tools.
    7. Discuss clock generation, clock distribution, clock skew in relationship to a control+datapath design.
    8. Use pipelining to improve the performance of a control+datapath design.
    9. Discuss applications that require serialization/de-serialization of bit streams, and implement a design that performs serialization/de-serialization.
