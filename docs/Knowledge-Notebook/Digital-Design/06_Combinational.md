??? info "Learning Outcomes"

    1. Describe and design single-bit/multi-bit structure/operation of combinational building blocks such as multiplexers, demultiplexers, decoders, and encoders.
    2. Describe and design the structure/operation of arithmetic building blocks such adders (ripple-carry), subtractor, shifters, and comparators.
    3. Describe and design structures for improving adder performance such as carry lookahead and carry select.
    4. Analyze and design combinational circuits (e.g., arithmetic logic unit, ALU) in a hierarchical, modular manner, using standard and custom combinational building blocks.
    5. Implement combinational building blocks and modular circuits using an HDL and generate/verify using appropriate design tools.
