??? info "Learning Outcomes"

    1. Define a clock signal using period, frequency, and duty-cycle parameters.
    2. Explain the structure/operation of basic latches (D, SR) and flip-flops (D, JK, T).
    3. Describe propagation delay, setup time, and hold time for basic latches and flip-flops.
    4. Describe and design the structure/operation of sequential building blocks such as registers, counters, and shift registers.
    5. Analyze and create timing diagrams for sequential block operation.
    6. Enumerate design tradeoffs in using different types of basic storage elements for sequential building block implementation.
    7. Implement sequential building blocks using an HDL and generate/verify using appropriate design tools.
    8. Describe the characteristics of static memory types such static SRAM, ROM, and EEPROM.
    9. Describe the characteristics of dynamic memories.
    10. Describe techniques (e.g., handshaking) of asynchronous design, and discuss their advantages (e.g., performance/power in some cases) and design issues (e.g., hazards such as race conditions, lack of tool support).
    11. Describe the characteristics of advanced memory technologies such as multi-port memories, double data rate (DDR) memories, and hybrid memories (e.g., hybrid memory cube, HMC).
