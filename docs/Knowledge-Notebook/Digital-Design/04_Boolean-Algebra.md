# DIG/Boolean algebra applications

??? info "Learning Outcomes"

    1. Define basic (AND, OR, NOT) and derived (e.g., NAND, NOR, XOR) Boolean operations.
    2. Enumerate Boolean algebra laws and theorems.
    3. Use basic and derived Boolean operations to evaluate Boolean expressions.
    4. Write and simplify Boolean expressions by applying appropriate laws and theorems and other techniques (e.g., Karnaugh maps).
