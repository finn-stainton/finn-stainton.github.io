# DIG/Fault models, testing, and design for testability

[:octicons-arrow-left-24: Return to Digital Design](/Knowledge-Notebook/Digital-Design/)

---

??? info "Learning Outcomes"

    1. Explain the need for systematic testing methods in digital design.
    2. Define fault models such as stuck-at, bridging, and delay.
    3. Define the terms controllability, observability, test coverage, and test generation when designing a method for testing a digital system.
    4. Describe design for testability methods such as ad-hoc, full-scan/partial scan and built-in-self-test (BIST).
    5. Describe the role of computer-aided testing tools for digital systems testing

## Systematic testing methods

- observability, 
- test coverage,
- test generation
  
## Testability methods 

- ad-hoc, 
- full-scan/partial scan and 
- built-in-self-test (BIST).
