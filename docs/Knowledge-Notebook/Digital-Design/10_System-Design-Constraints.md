# DIG/System design and constraints

[:octicons-arrow-left-24: Return to Digital Design](/Knowledge-Notebook/Digital-Design/)

??? info "Learning Outcomes"

    1. Contrast top-down versus bottom-up design methodologies for system design.
    2. Describe how to use logic synthesis timing constraints with an appropriate design tool for affecting logic generated for a control+datapath implementation.
    3. Use constraints of clock-cycle latency and clock-cycle throughput to create alternate designs for a digital system.
    4. Use other appropriate design tools (e.g., power estimator) for design space exploration and tradeoffs based on constraints such as performance, power, and cost.
    5. Describe the role of testability as a system design constraint and different approaches and tools for improving testability.
    6. Describe features/architecture of the JTAG standard and its role in digital systems testing.
    7. Create an HDL-based self-checking behavioral test bench for a digital system design.
