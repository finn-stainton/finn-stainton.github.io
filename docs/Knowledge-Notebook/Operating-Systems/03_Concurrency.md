??? info "Learning outcomes"

    1. Describe the need for concurrency within the framework of an operating system. [Familiarity]
    2. Demonstrate the potential run-time problems arising from the concurrent operation of many separate tasks. [Usage]
    3. Summarize the range of mechanisms that can be employed at the operating system level to realize concurrent systems and describe the benefits of each. [Familiarity]
    4. Explain the different states that a task may pass through and the data structures needed to support the management of many tasks. [Familiarity]
    5. Summarize techniques for achieving synchronization in an operating system (e.g., describe how to implement a semaphore using OS primitives). [Familiarity]
    6. Describe reasons for using interrupts, dispatching, and context switching to support concurrency in an operating system. [Familiarity]
    7. Create state and transition diagrams for simple problem domains. [Usage]
