Cross-reference [PD/Parallel Performance].

??? info "Learning outcomes"

    1. Explain how the components of system architecture contribute to improving its performance. [Familiarity]
    2. Describe Amdahl’s law and discuss its limitations. [Familiarity]
    3. Design and conduct a performance-oriented experiment. [Usage]
    4. Use software tools to profile and measure program performance. [Assessment]

## Performance figures of merit

## Workloads and representative benchmarks

, and methods of collecting and analyzing performance figures of merit

## CPI (Cycles per Instruction)

 equation as tool for understanding tradeoffs in the design of instruction sets, processor pipelines, and memory system organizations.

## Amdahl’s Law

: the part of the computation that cannot be sped up limits the effect of the parts that can
