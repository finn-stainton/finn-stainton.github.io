??? info "Learning outcomes"

    1. Describe computations as a system characyterized by a known set of configurations with transitions from one unique configuration (state) to another (state). [Familiarity]
    2. Describe the distinction between systems whose output is only a function of their input (Combinational) and those with memory/history (Sequential). [Familiarity]
    3. Describe a computer as a state machine that interprets machine instructions. [Familiarity]
    4. Explain how a program or network protocol can also be expressed as a state machine, and that alternative
    representations for the same computation can exist. [Familiarity]
    1. Develop state machine descriptions for simple problem statement solutions (e.g., traffic light sequencing,
    pattern recognizers). [Usage]
    1. Derive time-series behavior of a state machine from its state machine representation. [Assessment]

## Digital vs. Analog/Discrete vs. Continuous Systems

## Simple logic gates, logical expressions, Boolean logic simplification

## Clocks, State, Sequencing

## Combinational Logic, Sequential Logic, Registers, Memories

## Computers and Network Protocols as examples of state machines
