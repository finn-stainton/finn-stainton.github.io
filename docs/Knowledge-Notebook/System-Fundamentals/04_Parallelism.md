Cross-reference PD/Parallelism Fundamentals.

??? info "Learning outcomes"

1. For a given program, distinguish between its sequential and parallel execution, and the performance implications thereof. [Familiarity]
2. Demonstrate on an execution time line that parallelism events and operations can take place simultaneously (i.e., at the same time). Explain how work can be performed in less elapsed time if this can be exploited. [Familiarity]
3. Explain other uses of parallelism, such as for reliability/redundancy of execution. [Familiarity]
4. Define the differences between the concepts of Instruction Parallelism, Data Parallelism, Thread Parallelism/Multitasking, Task/Request Parallelism. [Familiarity]
5. Write more than one parallel program (e.g., one simple parallel program in more than one parallel programming paradigm; a simple parallel program that manages shared resources through synchronization primitives; a simple parallel program that performs simultaneous operation on partitioned data through task parallel (e.g., parallel search terms; a simple parallel program that performs step-by-step pipeline processing through message passing). [Usage]
6. Use performance tools to measure speed-up achieved by parallel programs in terms of both problem size and number of resources. [Assessment]

## Sequential vs. parallel processing

## Parallel programming vs. concurrent programming

## Request parallelism vs. Task parallelism

## Client-Server/Web Services, Thread (Fork-Join), Pipelining

## Multicore architectures and hardware support for synchronization
