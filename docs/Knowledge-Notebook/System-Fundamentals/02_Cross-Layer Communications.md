??? info "Learning outcomes"

    1. Describe how computing systems are constructed of layers upon layers, based on separation of concerns, with well-defined interfaces, hiding details of low layers from the higher layers. [Familiarity]
    2. Describe how hardware, VM, OS, and applications are additional layers of interpretation/processing. [Familiarity]
    3. Describe the mechanisms of how errors are detected, signaled back, and handled through the layers. [Familiarity]
    4. Construct a simple program using methods of layering, error detection and recovery, and reflection of error status across layers. [Usage]
    5. Find bugs in a layered program by using tools for program tracing, single stepping, and debugging. [Usage]

## Programming abstractions, interfaces, use of libraries

## Distinction between Application and OS services, Remote Procedure Call

## Application-Virtual Machine Interaction

## Reliability
