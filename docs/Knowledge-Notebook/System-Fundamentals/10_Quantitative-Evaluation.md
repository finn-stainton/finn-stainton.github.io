??? info "Learning outcomes"

1. Explain the circumstances in which a given figure of system performance metric is useful. [Familiarity]
2. Explain the inadequacies of benchmarks as a measure of system performance. [Familiarity]
3. Use limit studies or simple calculations to produce order-of-magnitude estimates for a given performance metric in a given context. [Usage]
4. Conduct a performance experiment on a layered system to determine the effect of a system parameter on figure of system performance. [Assessment]

## Analytical tools to guide quantitative evaluation

## Order of magnitude analysis (Big-Oh notation)

## Analysis of slow and fast paths of a system

## Events on their effect on performance

 (e.g., instruction stalls, cache misses, page faults)

## Understanding layered systems, workloads, and platforms, their implications for performance, and the challenges they represent for evaluation

## Microbenchmarking pitfalls
