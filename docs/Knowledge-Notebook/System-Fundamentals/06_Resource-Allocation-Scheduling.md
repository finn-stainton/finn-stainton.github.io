??? info "Learning outcomes"

    1. Define how finite computer resources (e.g., processor share, memory, storage and network bandwidth) are managed by their careful allocation to existing entities. [Familiarity]
    2. Describe the scheduling algorithms by which resources are allocated to competing entities, and the figures of merit by which these algorithms are evaluated, such as fairness. [Familiarity]
    3. Implement simple schedule algorithms. [Usage]
    4. Use figures of merit of alternative scheduler implementations. [Assessment]

## Kinds of resources

(e.g., processor share, memory, disk, net bandwidth)

## Kinds of scheduling

 (e.g., first-come, priority)

## Advantages of fair scheduling, preemptive scheduling
