??? info "Learning outcomes"

    1. Explain the distinction between program errors, system errors, and hardware faults (e.g., bad memory) and exceptions (e.g., attempt to divide by zero). [Familiarity]
    2. Articulate the distinction between detecting, handling, and recovering from faults, and the methods for their implementation. [Familiarity]
    3. Describe the role of error correcting codes in providing error checking and correction techniques in memories, storage, and networks. [Familiarity]
    4. Apply simple algorithms for exploiting redundant information for the purposes of data correction. [Usage]
    5. Compare different error detection and correction methods for their data overhead, implementation complexity, and relative execution time for encoding, detecting, and correcting errors. [Assessment]

## Distinction between bugs and faults

## Redundancy through check and retry

## Redundancy through redundant encoding (error correcting codes, CRC, FEC)

## Duplication/mirroring/replicas

## Other approaches to fault tolerance and availability
