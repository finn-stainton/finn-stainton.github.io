??? info "Learning outcomes"

    1. Explain the importance of locality in determining performance. [Familiarity]
    2. Describe why things that are close in space take less time to access. [Familiarity]
    3. Calculate average memory access time and describe the tradeoffs in memory hierarchy performance in terms of capacity, miss/hit rate, and access time. [Assessment]

## Speed of light and computers

 (one foot per nanosecond vs. one GHz clocks)

## Latencies in computer systems

: memory vs. disk latencies vs. across the network memory

## Caches and the effects of spatial and temporal locality on performance in processors and systems

## Caches and cache coherency in databases, operating systems, distributed systems, and computer architecture

## Introduction into the processor memory hierarchy and the formula for average memory access time
