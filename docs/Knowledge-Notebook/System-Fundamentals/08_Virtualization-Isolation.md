??? info "Learning outcomes"

    1. Explain why it is important to isolate and protect the execution of individual programs and environments that share common underlying resources. [Familiarity]
    2. Describe how the concept of indirection can create the illusion of a dedicated machine and its resources even when physically shared among multiple programs and environments. [Familiarity]
    3. Measure the performance of two application instances running on separate virtual machines, and determine the effect of performance isolation. [Assessment]

## Rationale for protection and predictable performance

## Levels of indirection, illustrated by virtual memory for managing physical memory resources

## Methods for implementing virtual memory and virtual machines
