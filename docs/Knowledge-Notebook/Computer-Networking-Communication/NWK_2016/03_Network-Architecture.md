    - State the fundamental concepts of networks and their topologies.
    - Contrast network architectures with the network’s hardware components.
    - Contrast the elements of a protocol with the concept of layering.
    - Explain the importance of networking standards and their regulatory committees.
    - Describe the seven layers of the OSI model.
    - Define the role of networking and internetworking devices such as repeaters, bridges, switches, routers, and gateways. 
    - Explains the pros and cons of network topologies such as mesh, star, tree, bus, ring, and 3-D torus.
    - Describe the TCP/IP model.
    - Contrast the TCP/IP model with the OSI model.
