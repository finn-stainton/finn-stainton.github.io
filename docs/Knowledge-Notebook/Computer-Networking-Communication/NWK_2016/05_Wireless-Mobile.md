??? info "Learning Outcomes"

    - Explain the source of changes in the wireless and mobile industry from the view point of new service models such as the mobile ecosystem (e.g., Apple and Android ecosystems).
    - Describe the fundamental components that tend to be unchanged for long periods such as mobile IP, Wi-Fi, and cellular.
    - Explain the potential issues in wireless media access such as the hidden terminal problem and the exposed terminal problem.
    - Explain the basics of a Wi-Fi network such as protocol stack and frame structure as well as its development such as IEEE802.11 a/b/g/n
    series standards.
    - Contrast the basic concepts in cellular network such network architecture, framework, and LTE.
    - Describe the main characteristics of mobile IP and explain how it differs from standard IP regarding mobility management and location
    management; illustrate how traffic is routed using mobile IP.
    - Describe features of typical wireless MAC protocols.
    - Explain wireless CSMA/CA and RTS/CTS enhancement mechanisms.
