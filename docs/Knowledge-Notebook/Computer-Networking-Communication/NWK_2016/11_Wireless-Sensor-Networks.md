??? info "Learning Outcomes"

    - Describe the features of wireless sensor network (WSN) systems. 
    - Describe the MAC and routing protocols of WSNs.
    - Discuss the requirements and strategies of WSN data fusion.
    - Provide an example of a real application of WSNs.
    - Contrast circuit switching vs packet switching: virtual circuit switching (MPLS).
