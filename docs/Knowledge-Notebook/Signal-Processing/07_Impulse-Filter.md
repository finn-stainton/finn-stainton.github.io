??? info "Learning Outcomes:"

    1. Design finite and infinite impulse response (FIR and IIR) filters that have specified frequency characteristics including magnitude and phase responses.
    2. Explain the general tradeoffs between FIR and IIR filters.
    3. Demonstrate that not all recursive filters are IIR, using a moving average as an example.
    4. Use the DFT to accomplish filtering through (circular) convolution.
    5. State the condition for linear phase in an FIR filter.
    6. Explain the tradeoffs between spectral resolution, length, and delay in an FIR filter.
    7. Explain why one or more FIR filter design methods work.
    8. Explain why one or more IIR filter design methods work including notch filters using pole-zero pairs.
    9. Design a digital filter using analog techniques (e.g., bilinear transform) and explain its key parameters.
    10. Explain physically realizable system issues relevant in filter design including causality and time shifts, and response truncation.
