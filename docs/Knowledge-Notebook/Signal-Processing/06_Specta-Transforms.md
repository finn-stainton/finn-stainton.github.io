??? info "Learning Outcomes:"

    1. Sketch the spectrum of a periodic signal.
    2. Contrast the spectra of an impulse and a square wave.
    3. Calculate spectra of periodic and aperiodic signals.
    4. Explain how the block size controls the tradeoff between spectral resolution and density.
    5. Calculate a spectrogram and explain what its key parameters are.
    6. Explain filtering as adding spectra in a frequency domain on a logarithmic scale.
    7. Design interpolation and reconstruction filters using the sinc function.
