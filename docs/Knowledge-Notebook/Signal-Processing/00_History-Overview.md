??? info "Learning Outcomes:"

    1. Explain the purpose and role of digital signal processing and multimedia in computer engineering.
    2. Explain some important signal processing areas such as digital audio, multimedia, image processing, video, signal compression, signal detection, and digital filters.
    3. Contrast analog and digital signals using the concepts of sampling and quantization.
    4. Draw a digital signal processing block diagram and define its key components: antialiasing filter, analog to digital converter, digital signal processing, digital to analog filter, and reconstruction filter.
    5. Explain the need for using transforms and how they differ for analog and discrete-time signals.
    6. Contrast some techniques used in transformations such as Laplace, Fourier, and wavelet transforms.
    7. Indicate design criteria for low- and high-pass filters.
