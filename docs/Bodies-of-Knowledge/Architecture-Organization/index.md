# Architecture and Organization (AR)

Computing professionals should not regard the computer as just a black box that executes programs by magic. The knowledge area Architecture and Organization builds on [Systems Fundamentals (SF)](/Bodies-of-Knowledge/System-Fundamentals) to develop a deeper understanding of the hardware environment upon which all computing is based, and the interface it provides to higher software layers. Students should acquire an understanding and appreciation of a computer system’s functional components, their characteristics, performance, and interactions, and, in particular, the challenge of harnessing parallelism to sustain performance improvements now and into the future. Students need to understand computer architecture to develop programs that can achieve high performance through a programmer’s awareness of parallelism and latency. In selecting a system to use, students should be able to understand the tradeoff among various components, such as CPU clock speed, cycles per instruction, memory size, and average memory access time.
