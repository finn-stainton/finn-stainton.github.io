??? info "Learning Outcomes"

    1. Describe superscalar architectures and their advantages. [Familiarity]
    2. Explain the concept of branch prediction and its utility. [Familiarity]
    3. Characterize the costs and benefits of prefetching. [Familiarity]
    4. Explain speculative execution and identify the conditions that justify it. [Familiarity]
    5. Discuss the performance advantages that multithreading offered in an architecture along with the factors
    that make it difficult to derive maximum benefits from this approach. [Familiarity]
