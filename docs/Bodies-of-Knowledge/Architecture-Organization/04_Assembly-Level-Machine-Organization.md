??? info "Learning Outcomes"

    1. Explain the organization of the classical von Neumann machine and its major functional units. [Familiarity]
    2. Describe how an instruction is executed in a classical von Neumann machine, with extensions for threads, multiprocessor synchronization, and SIMD execution. [Familiarity]
    3. Describe instruction level parallelism and hazards, and how they are managed in typical processor pipelines. [Familiarity]
    4. Summarize how instructions are represented at both the machine level and in the context of a symbolic assembler. [Familiarity]
    5. Demonstrate how to map between high-level language patterns into assembly/machine language notations. [Familiarity]
    6. Explain different instruction formats, such as addresses per instruction and variable length vs. fixed length formats. [Familiarity]
    7. Explain how subroutine calls are handled at the assembly level. [Familiarity]
    8. Explain the basic concepts of interrupts and I/O operations. [Familiarity]
    9. Write simple assembly language program segments. [Usage]
    10. Show how fundamental high-level programming constructs are implemented at the machine-language level. [Usage]

## Basic organization of the von Neumann machine

## Control unit; 

- instruction fetch, 
- decode, 
- execution
  
## Instruction sets and types 

(data manipulation, control, I/O)

## Assembly/machine language programming

## Instruction formats

## Addressing modes

## Subroutine call and return mechanisms 

cross-reference [PL/Language Translation and Execution]())

## I/O and interrupts

## Heap vs. Static vs. Stack vs. Code segments

## Shared memory multiprocessors/multicore organization

## Introduction to SIMD vs. MIMD and the Flynn Taxonomy
