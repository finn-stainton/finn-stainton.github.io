# CAE/Mixed-signal circuit design

??? info "Learning Outcomes"

    1. Discuss common types of mixed-signal circuits and applications, including digital-to-analog (D/A) and analog-to-digital (A/D) converters and sample-and-hold circuits.
    2. Describe key characteristics of D/A and A/D converters, such as least-significant bit (LSB), linearity, offset, and gain errors.
    3. Contrast the properties that distinguish between specific D/A and A/D converters for meeting system design requirements.
    4. Analyze issues associated with the integration of digital and analog circuits in a single IC or package, including both benefits and challenges.
    5. Provide examples of commercial mixed-signal devices.
    6. Describe how D/A converter characteristics depend upon implementation; examples include weighted resistor, R/2R resistor ladders, weighted current source converters, and delta-sigma converters.
    7. Describe how A/D converter characteristics depend upon implementation; examples include successive approximation converters, single and dual slope converters, flash converters, and delta-sigma converters.
    8. Design A/D and D/A converters to meet given criteria using specified implementations.
