??? info "Learning Outcomes:"
    1. Explain how user-centered design complements other software process models. [Familiarity]
    2. Use lo-fi (low fidelity) prototyping techniques to gather, and report, user responses. [Usage]
    3. Choose appropriate methods to support the development of a specific UI. [Assessment]
    4. Use a variety of techniques to evaluate a given UI. [Assessment]
    5. Compare the constraints and benefits of different evaluative methods. [Assessment]

- Approaches to, and characteristics of, the design process
- Functionality and usability requirements (cross-reference to SE/Requirements Engineering)
- Techniques for gathering requirements, e.g., interviews, surveys, ethnographic and contextual enquiry
- Techniques and tools for the analysis and presentation of requirements, e.g., reports, personas
- Prototyping techniques and tools, e.g., sketching, storyboards, low-fidelity prototyping, wireframes
- Evaluation without users, using both qualitative and quantitative techniques, e.g., walkthroughs, GOMS,
expert-based analysis, heuristics, guidelines, and standards
- Evaluation with users, e.g., observation, think-aloud, interview, survey, experiment
- Challenges to effective evaluation, e.g., sampling, generalization
- Reporting the results of evaluations
- Internationalization, designing for users from other cultures, cross-cultural
