??? info "Learning outcomes"

    1. Describe when non-mouse interfaces are appropriate. [Familiarity]
    2. Understand the interaction possibilities beyond mouse-and-pointer interfaces. [Familiarity]
    3. Discuss the advantages (and disadvantages) of non-mouse interfaces. [Assessment]

- Choosing interaction styles and interaction techniques
- Representing information to users: navigation, representation, manipulation
- Approaches to design, implementation and evaluation of non-mouse interaction
    - Touch and multi-touch interfaces
    - Shared, embodied, and large interfaces
    - New input modalities (such as sensor and location data)
    - New Windows, e.g., iPhone, Android
    - Speech recognition and natural language processing (cross reference IS/Natural Language Processing)
    - Wearable and tangible interfaces
    - Persuasive interaction and emotion
    - Ubiquitous and context-aware interaction technologies (Ubicomp)
    - Bayesian inference (e.g. predictive text, guided pointing)
    - Ambient/peripheral display and interaction
