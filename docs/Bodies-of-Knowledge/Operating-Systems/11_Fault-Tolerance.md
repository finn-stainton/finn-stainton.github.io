??? info "Learning outcomes"

    1. Explain the relevance of the terms fault tolerance, reliability, and availability. [Familiarity]
    2. Outline the range of methods for implementing fault tolerance in an operating system. [Familiarity]
    3. Explain how an operating system can continue functioning after a fault occurs. [Familiarity]

## Fundamental concepts: reliable and available systems

(cross-reference SF/Reliability through Redundancy)

## Spatial and temporal redundancy

(cross-reference SF/Reliability through Redundancy)

## Methods used to implement fault tolerance

## Examples of OS mechanisms for detection, recovery, restart to implement fault tolerance, use of these techniques for the OSâ€™s own services
