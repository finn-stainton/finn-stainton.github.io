??? info "Learning outcomes"

    1. Explain memory hierarchy and cost-performance trade-offs. [Familiarity]
    2. Summarize the principles of virtual memory as applied to caching and paging. [Familiarity]
    3. Evaluate the trade-offs in terms of memory size (main memory, cache memory, auxiliary memory) and processor speed. [Assessment]
    4. Defend the different ways of allocating memory to tasks, citing the relative merits of each. [Assessment]
    5. Describe the reason for and use of cache memory (performance and proximity, different dimension of how caches complicate isolation and VM abstraction). [Familiarity]
    6. Discuss the concept of thrashing, both in terms of the reasons it occurs and the techniques used to recognize and manage the problem. [Familiarity]
