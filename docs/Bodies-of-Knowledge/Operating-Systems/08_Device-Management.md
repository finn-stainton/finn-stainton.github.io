??? info "Learning outcomes"

    1. Explain the key difference between serial and parallel devices and identify the conditions in which each is appropriate. [Familiarity]
    2. Identify the relationship between the physical hardware and the virtual devices maintained by the operating system. [Usage]
    3. Explain buffering and describe strategies for implementing it. [Familiarity]
    4. Differentiate the mechanisms used in interfacing a range of devices (including hand-held devices, networks, multimedia) to a computer and explain the implications of these for the design of an operating system. [Usage]
    5. Describe the advantages and disadvantages of direct memory access and discuss the circumstances in which its use is warranted. [Usage]
    6. Identify the requirements for failure recovery. [Familiarity]
    7. Implement a simple device driver for a range of possible devices. [Usage]
