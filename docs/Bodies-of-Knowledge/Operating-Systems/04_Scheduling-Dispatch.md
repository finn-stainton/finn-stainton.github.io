??? info "Learning outcomes"

    1. Compare and contrast the common algorithms used for both preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling of tasks in operating systems, such as priority, performance comparison, and fair-share schemes. [Usage]
    2. Describe relationships between scheduling algorithms and application domains. [Familiarity]
    3. Discuss the types of processor scheduling such as short-term, medium-term, long-term, and I/O. [Familiarity]
    4. Describe the difference between processes and threads. [Usage]
    5. Compare and contrast static and dynamic approaches to real-time scheduling. [Usage]
    6. Discuss the need for preemption and deadline scheduling. [Familiarity]
    7. Identify ways that the logic embodied in scheduling algorithms are applicable to other domains, such as disk I/O, network scheduling, project scheduling, and problems beyond computing. [Usage]
