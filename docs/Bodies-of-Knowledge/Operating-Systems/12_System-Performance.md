    1. Describe the performance measurements used to determine how a system performs. [Familiarity]
    2. Explain the main evaluation models used to evaluate a system. [Familiarity]

## Why system performance needs to be evaluated

(cross-reference SF/Performance/Figures of performance merit)

## What is to be evaluated

(cross-reference SF/Performance/Figures of performance merit)

## Systems performance policies

, e.g., caching, paging, scheduling, memory management, and security

## Evaluation models

deterministic, analytic, simulation, or implementation-specific

## How to collect evaluation data

(profiling and tracing mechanisms)
