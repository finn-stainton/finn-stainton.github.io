## Note Taking

### Mind Mapping

### Cornell

## Time Management

Accurately predicting how much time it will take to do a task, and then setting aside that amount of time to complete it. Estimations must take into account unknowns, interruptions or unforeseen problems that cause delays. Estimation includes:

- Understanding the requirements of each assignment or task
- Knowing all the materials, data, information, and resources you may need
- Awareness of research time, waiting time, and response time
- Ensuring that you know the order or dependencies of steps
- Recognising any interim due dates (such as a first draft)

Estimation depends on the content of the task.

| General Academic Reading | 1 Page | 7 minutes |
| Technical Reading | 1 Page | 15 minutes |
| Writing: Short, No Research | Per Page | |
| Writing: Research (Depends on topic) | Per Page | |

Prioritise tasks by understanding all the requirements first. 

How to check requirements?

- Read the assignment fully and take detailed notes when the instructor describes it
- Ask questions; don't assume
- If able to, get a review of progress, take it
- If you need pre-requisite time for a task, build it into the schedule. This could include, lab, research, device time or a response for others.
1. **Increase Personal Responsibility: I am** responsible for navigating around roadblocks and overcoming them. Take control of the journey! Issues are not other people's problems but for me to solve. 
2. **Reward yourself for Completing the Task:** Rewards for a job well done (acknowledge the achievement). 
3. **Make Certain they are MY Goals:**
4. **Visualise the result:**
5. **Break the Goal down into manageable tasks:**
6. **Tap Into other people's energy** 
7. **Remind Myself why I set the Goal**

Procrastination can become a serious problem when it becomes chronic and/or there are a large number of tasks to complete in little time or the task is important.  

- **Get Organised**: The most effective way to address procrastination is to use management strategies like, scheduling, goal setting or techniques to accomplish tasks in a timely manner.
- **Reduce/eliminate distractions**: Save them for later.
- **Reward Yourself:** Use the distraction as a reward for completing a goal instead of it holding you back. Set standards for the goal.
- **Be Accountable – Tell Someone:** Tell them what and when. Even future You (Trial). Set a level of commitment. Get approval

## Highlighting

1. Reason for Highlighting: may change by subject or objective. 
   1. Organise:
   2. Emphasise:
   3. Remind:
   4. Reuse: (for an essay, etc.)
   5. Preparing for a discussion
   6. Minor quiz
   7. Study for examination
2. Use different colours and styles:
3. Take note of the highlighted section: Why
4. Read the page before highlighting: Understand the content before highlighting only the most important material.
5. Don't over highlight: Brief phrases to emphasise, remind or organise thoughts. Take notes and ask questions along the way. ND. Essays may require long highlights for future reuse

Frame highlights around emphasised learning objectives in lectures slides and textbooks. 

Change colour with different elements. E.g. Cause and Effect maybe pink. 

Highlight concepts that link together over a course, book, chapter.

## Reading

### Active Reading

Do all of these processes as you read. 

1. Accessing Prior Knowledge: Bring knowledge about the topic to the reading session.
2. Asking Questions: Oral and Written pertinent questions about the content. (Expand)
3. Inferring and Implying: Information from what you read. *This means that xyz…* 
4. Learning Vocabulary: take note, practice dictation and spelling
5. Evaluating: what you are reading. (How)
6. Applying: what you're reading to other learnings/ life situations.
