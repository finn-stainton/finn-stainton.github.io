??? info "Learning Outcomes"

    1. Interpret the properties of an ideal operational amplifier (op-amp).
    2. Analyze and design circuits containing ideal op-amp circuits to include inverting and non-inverting amplifiers, summing and difference amplifiers, integrators, and low-pass filters.
    3. Contrast the properties of non-ideal op-amps to include DC errors, common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR), input and output resistances, frequency response, output voltage, and current limitations.
    4. Analyze and design simple circuits containing non-ideal op-amps.
    5. Contrast and design multistage op-amp circuits.
