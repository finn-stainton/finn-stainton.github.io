??? info "Learning Outcomes"

1. Predict the benefits and drawbacks associated with simulation as a method of circuit analysis.
2. Apply simulation methods for DC analysis, AC analysis, transient analysis, and steady-state analysis.
3. Identify aspects of circuits that are not readily amenable to simulation.
4. Contrast methods and parameters for controlling simulation to include built-in device models, device parameter controls, and device and circuit libraries.
