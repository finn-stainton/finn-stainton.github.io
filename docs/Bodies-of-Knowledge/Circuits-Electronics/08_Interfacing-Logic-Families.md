??? info "Learning Outcomes"

    1. Explain the practical difficulties resulting from interfacing signals within a system and to the external world.
    2. Employ terminal characteristics of various logic families and of standard interfaces.
    3. Write the requirements for common signal translations between different logic families, such as between transistor-transistor logic (TTL) and CMOS.
    4. Illustrate common methods to overcome difficulties when interfacing different logic families.
    5. Explain the practical difficulties resulting from single-ended to differential and differential to single-ended conversions.
    6. Contrast transmission line characteristics, reflections, and options for bus termination including passive, active, DC, and alternating current (AC) features.
