??? info "Learning Outcomes:"

    1. Analyze and explain the behavior of simple programs involving the fundamental programming
    constructs variables, expressions, assignments, I/O, control constructs, functions, parameter passing, and recursion. [Assessment]
    1. Identify and describe uses of primitive data types. [Familiarity]
    2. Write programs that use primitive data types. [Usage]
    3. Modify and expand short programs that use standard conditional and iterative control structures and functions. [Usage]
    4. Design, implement, test, and debug a program that uses each of the following fundamental
    programming constructs: basic computation, simple I/O, standard conditional and iterative structures, the definition of functions, and parameter passing. [Usage]
    1. Write a program that uses file I/O to provide persistence across multiple executions. [Usage]
    2. Choose appropriate conditional and iteration constructs for a given programming task. [Assessment]
    3. Describe the concept of recursion and give examples of its use. [Familiarity]
    4. Identify the base case and the general case of a recursively-defined problem. [Assessment]
