# SDF/Development Methods

??? "Learning Outcomes:"

    1. Trace the execution of a variety of code segments and write summaries of their computations. [Assessment]
    2. Explain why the creation of correct program components is important in the production of high-quality software. [Familiarity]
    3. Identify common coding errors that lead to insecure programs (e.g., buffer overflows, memory leaks, malicious code) and apply strategies for avoiding such errors. [Usage]
    4. Conduct a personal code review (focused on common coding errors) on a program component using a provided checklist. [Usage]
    5. Contribute to a small-team code review focused on component correctness. [Usage]
    6. Describe how a contract can be used to specify the behavior of a program component. [Familiarity]
    7. Refactor a program by identifying opportunities to apply procedural abstraction. [Usage]
    8. Apply a variety of strategies to the testing and debugging of simple programs. [Usage]
    9. Construct, execute and debug programs using a modern IDE and associated tools such as unit testing tools and visual debuggers. [Usage]
    10. Construct and debug programs using the standard libraries available with a chosen programming language. [Usage]
    11. Analyze the extent to which another programmerâ€™s code meets documentation and programming style standards. [Assessment]
    12. Apply consistent documentation and program style standards that contribute to the readability and maintainability of software. [Usage]
