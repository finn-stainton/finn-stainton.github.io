# SDF/Fundamental Data Structures

??? "Learning Outcomes:"

    1. Discuss the appropriate use of built-in data structures. [Familiarity]
    2. Describe common applications for each of the following data structures: stack, queue, priority queue, set, and map. [Familiarity]
    3. Write programs that use each of the following data structures: arrays, records/structs, strings, linked lists, stacks, queues, sets, and maps. [Usage]
    4. Compare alternative implementations of data structures with respect to performance. [Assessment]
    5. Describe how references allow for objects to be accessed in multiple ways. [Familiarity]
    6. Compare and contrast the costs and benefits of dynamic and static data structure implementations. [Assessment]
    7. Choose the appropriate data structure for modeling a given problem. [Assessment]
