# Social Issues and Professional Practice (SP)

While technical issues are central to the computing curriculum, they do not constitute a complete educational program in the field. Students must also be exposed to the larger societal context of computing to develop an understanding of the relevant social, ethical, legal and professional issues. This need to incorporate the study of these non-technical issues into the ACM curriculum was formally recognized in 1991, as can be seen from the following excerpt [2]: Undergraduates also need to understand the basic cultural, social, legal, and ethical issues inherent in the discipline of computing. They should understand where the discipline has been, where it is, and where it is heading. They should also understand their individual roles in this process, as well as appreciate the philosophical questions, technical problems, and aesthetic values that play an important part in the development of the discipline. Students also need to develop the ability to ask serious questions about the social impact of computing and to evaluate proposed answers to those questions. Future practitioners must be able to anticipate the impact of introducing a given product into a given environment. Will that product enhance or degrade the quality of life? What will the impact be upon individuals, groups, and institutions?

Finally, students need to be aware of the basic legal rights of software and hardware vendors and users, and they also need to appreciate the ethical values that are the basis for those rights. Future practitioners must understand the responsibility that they will bear, and the possible consequences of failure. They must understand their own limitations as well as the limitations of their tools. All practitioners must make a long- term commitment to remaining current in their chosen specialties and in the discipline of computing as a whole.

As technological advances continue to significantly impact the way we live and work, the critical importance of social issues and professional practice continues to increase; new computer-based products and venues pose ever more challenging problems each year. It is our students who must enter the workforce and academia with intentional regard for the identification and resolution of these problems. Computer science educators may opt to deliver this core and elective material in stand-alone courses, integrated into traditional technical and theoretical courses, or as special units in capstone and professional practice courses. The material in this familiarity area is best covered through a combination of one required course along with short modules in other courses. On the one hand, some units listed as Core Tier-1 (in particular, Social Context, Analytical Tools, Professional Ethics, and Intellectual Property) do not readily lend themselves to being covered in other traditional courses. Without a standalone course, it is difficult to cover these topics appropriately. On the other hand, if ethical and social considerations are covered only in the standalone course and not “in context,” it will reinforce the false notion that technical processes are void of these other relevant issues. Because of this broad relevance, it is important that several traditional courses include modules with case studies that analyze the ethical, legal, social and professional considerations in the context of the technical subject matter of the course. Courses in areas such as software engineering, databases, computer networks, information assurance and security, and introduction to computing provide obvious context for analysis of ethical issues. However, an ethics-related module could be developed for almost any course in the curriculum. It would be explicitly against the spirit of the recommendations to have only a standalone course. Running through all of the issues in this area is the need to speak to the computing practitioner’s responsibility to proactively address these issues by both moral and technical actions. The ethical issues discussed in any class should be directly related to and arise naturally from the subject matter of that class. Examples include a discussion in the database course of data aggregation or data mining, or a discussion in the software engineering course of the potential conflicts between obligations to the customer and obligations to the user and others affected by their work. Programming assignments built around applications such as controlling the movement of a laser during eye surgery can help to address the professional, ethical and social impacts of computing. Computing faculty who are unfamiliar with the content and/or pedagogy of applied ethics are urged to take advantage of the considerable resources from ACM, IEEE-CS, SIGCAS (special interest group on computers and society), and other organizations. It should be noted that the application of ethical analysis underlies every subsection of this Social and Professional knowledge area in computing. The ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct (http://www.acm.org/about/code-of-ethics) provides guidelines that serve as the basis for the conduct of our professional work. The General Moral Imperatives provide an understanding of our commitment to personal responsibility, professional conduct, and our leadership roles.

## SP/Social Context

Computers and the Internet, perhaps more than any other technologies, have transformed society over the past 75 years, with dramatic increases in human productivity; an explosion of options for news, entertainment, and communication; and fundamental breakthroughs in almost every branch of science and engineering. Social Context provides the foundation for all other SP knowledge units, especially Professional Ethics. Also see cross-referencing with Human- Computer Interaction (HCI) and Networking and Communication (NC) Knowledge Areas.

**Topics**:

- Social implications of computing in a networked world (cross-reference HCI/Foundations/social models; IAS/Fundamental Concepts/social issues)
- Impact of social media on individualism, collectivism and culture.

## SP/Analytical Tools

Ethical theories and principles are the foundations of ethical analysis because they are the
viewpoints from which guidance can be obtained along the pathway to a decision. Each theory
emphasizes different points such as predicting the outcome and following one's duties to others
in order to reach an ethically guided decision. However, in order for an ethical theory to be
useful, the theory must be directed towards a common set of goals. Ethical principles are the
common goals that each theory tries to achieve in order to be successful. These goals include
beneficence, least harm, respect for autonomy, and justice.
