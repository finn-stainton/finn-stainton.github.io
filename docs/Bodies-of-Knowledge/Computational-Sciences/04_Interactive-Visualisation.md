# CN/ Interactive Visualisation

[:octicons-arrow-left-24: Return to Computational Sciences](/Bodies-of-Knowledge/Computational-Sciences/)

---

This sub-area is related to modeling and simulation. Most topics are discussed in detail in other knowledge areas in this document. There are many ways to present data and information, including immersion, realism, variable perspectives; haptics and heads-up displays, sonification, and gesture mapping.

Interactive visualization in general requires understanding of human perception (GV/Basics); graphics pipelines, geometric representations and data structures (GV/Fundamental Concepts); 2D and 3D rendering, surface and volume rendering (GV/Rendering, GV/Modeling, and GV/Advanced Rendering); and the use of APIs for developing user interfaces using standard input components such as menus, sliders, and buttons; and standard output components for data display, including charts, graphs, tables, and histograms (HCI/GUI Construction, HCI/GUI Programming).

??? info "Learning outcomes"

    1. Compare common computer interface mechanisms with respect to ease-of-use, learnability, and cost. [Assessment]
    2. Use standard APIs and tools to create visual displays of data, including graphs, charts, tables, and histograms. [Usage]
    3. Describe several approaches to using a computer as a means for interacting with and processing data. [Familiarity]
    4. Extract useful information from a dataset. [Assessment]
    5. Analyze and select visualization techniques for specific problems. [Assessment]
    6. Describe issues related to scaling data analysis from small to large data sets. [Familiarity]
