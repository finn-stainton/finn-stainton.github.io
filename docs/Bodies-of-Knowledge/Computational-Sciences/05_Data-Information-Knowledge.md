[:octicons-arrow-left-24: Return to Computational Sciences](/Bodies-of-Knowledge/Computational-Sciences/)

---

Many topics are discussed in detail in other knowledge areas in this document, specifically Information Management (IM/Information Management Concepts, IM/Database Systems, and IM/Data Modeling), Algorithms and Complexity (AL/Basic Analysis, AL/Fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms), and Software Development Fundamentals (SDF/Fundamental Programming Concepts, SDF/Development Methods).

??? info "Learning outcomes"

    1. Identify all of the data, information, and knowledge elements and related organizations, for a computational science application. [Assessment]
    2. Describe how to represent data and information for processing. [Familiarity]
    3. Describe typical user requirements regarding that data, information, and knowledge. [Familiarity]
    4. Select a suitable system or software implementation to manage data, information, and knowledge. [Assessment]
    5. List and describe the reports, transactions, and other processing needed for a computational science application. [Familiarity]
    6. Compare and contrast database management, information retrieval, and digital library systems with regard to handling typical computational science applications. [Assessment]
    7. Design a digital library for some computational science users/societies, with appropriate content and services. [Usage]

## Content management models, frameworks, systems, design methods 

(as in IM. Information Management)

## Digital representations of content

### numbers

### text

### images

- raster
- vector

### video

(e.g., QuickTime, MPEG2, MPEG4)

### audio

(e.g., written score, MIDI, sampled digitized sound track)

### animations

complex/composite/aggregate objects; FRBR

## Digital content creation/capture and preservation

including digitization, sampling, compression, conversion, transformation/translation, migration/emulation, crawling, harvesting

## Content structure / management

including digital libraries and static/dynamic/stream aspects for:

- Data: data structures, databases
- Information: document collections, multimedia pools, hyperbases (hypertext, hypermedia),catalogs, repositories
- Knowledge: ontologies, triple stores, semantic networks, rules

## Processing and pattern recognition

including indexing, searching (including: queries and query languages; central / federated / P2P), retrieving, clustering, classifying/categorizing, analyzing/mining/extracting, rendering, reporting, handling transactions

## User / society support for presentation and interaction

including browse, search, filter, route, visualize, share, collaborate, rate, annotate, personalize, recommend

## Modeling, design, logical and physical implementation, using relevant systems/software
