Computational Science is a field of applied computer science, that is, the application of computer science to solve problems across a range of disciplines.

In the book Introduction to Computational Science (3), the authors offer the following definition: “the field of computational science combines computer simulation, scientific visualization, mathematical modeling, computer programming and data structures, networking, database design, symbolic computation, and high performance computing with various disciplines.” Computer science, which largely  focuses on the theory, design, and implementation of algorithms for manipulating data and information, can trace its roots to the earliest devices used to assist people in computation over four thousand years ago. Various systems were created and used to calculate astronomical positions. Ada Lovelace’s programming achievement was intended to calculate Bernoulli numbers. In the late nineteenth century, mechanical calculators became available, and were immediately put to use by scientists. The needs of scientists and engineers for computation have long driven research and innovation in computing. As computers increase in their problem-solving power, computational science has grown in both breadth and importance. It is a discipline in its own right (2) and is considered to be “one of the five college majors on the rise (1).” 

An amazing assortment of sub-fields have arisen under the umbrella of Computational Science, including computational biology, computational chemistry, computational mechanics, computational archeology, computational finance, computational sociology and computational forensics. Some fundamental concepts of computational science are germane to every computer scientist (e.g., modeling and simulation), and computational science topics are extremely valuable components of an undergraduate program in computer science. This area offers exposure to many valuable ideas and techniques, including precision of numerical representation, error analysis, numerical techniques, parallel architectures and algorithms, modeling and simulation, information visualization, software engineering, and optimization. 

Topics relevant to computational science include:

- fundamental concepts in program construction [(SDF/Fundamental Programming Concepts)](../Software-Development-Fundamentals/02_Fundamental-Programming-Concepts.md)
- algorithm design [(SDF/Algorithms and Design)](../Software-Development-Fundamentals/01_Algorithms-Design.md)
- program testing [(SDF/Development Methods)](../Software-Development-Fundamentals/04_Development-Methods.md)
- data representations [(AR/Machine Representation of Data)](../Architecture-Organisation/03_Representation-Data.md)
- basic computer architecture [(AR/Memory System Organization and Architecture)](../Architecture-Organisation/05_Memory-System-Organization-Architecture.md).

At the same time, students who take courses in this area have an opportunity to apply these techniques in a wide range of application areas, such as molecular and fluid dynamics, celestial mechanics, economics, biology, geology, medicine, and social network analysis. Many of the techniques used in these areas require advanced mathematics such as calculus, differential equations, and linear algebra. The descriptions here assume that students have acquired the needed mathematical background elsewhere. In the computational science community, the terms run, modify, and create are often used to describe levels of understanding. This chapter follows the conventions of other chapters in this volume and uses the terms familiarity, usage, and assessment.
