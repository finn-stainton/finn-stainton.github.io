??? info "Learning Outcomes"

    1. For each of the strategies (brute-force, greedy, divide-and-conquer, recursive backtracking, and dynamic programming), identify a practical example to which it would apply. [Familiarity]
    2. Use a greedy approach to solve an appropriate problem and determine if the greedy rule chosen leads to an optimal solution. [Assessment]
    3. Use a divide-and-conquer algorithm to solve an appropriate problem. [Usage]
    4. Use recursive backtracking to solve a problem such as navigating a maze. [Usage]
    5. Use dynamic programming to solve an appropriate problem. [Usage]
    6. Determine an appropriate algorithmic approach to a problem. [Assessment]
