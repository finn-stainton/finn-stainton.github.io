??? info "Learning Outcomes"

    1. Define the classes P and NP. (Also appears in AL/Basic Automata, Computability, and Complexity).[Familiarity]
    2. Define the P-space class and its relation to the EXP class. [Familiarity]
    3. Explain the significance of NP-completeness. (Also appears in AL/Basic Automata, Computability, and Complexity). [Familiarity]
    4. Provide examples of classic NP-complete problems. [Familiarity]
    5. Prove that a problem is NP-complete by reducing a classic known NP-complete problem to it. [Usage]
