??? info "Learning Outcomes"

    1. Identify the main types of memory technology (e.g., SRAM, DRAM, Flash, magnetic disk) and their
    relative cost and performance. [Familiarity]
    1. Explain the effect of memory latency on running time. [Familiarity]
    2. Describe how the use of memory hierarchy (cache, virtual memory) is used to reduce the effective memory
    latency. [Familiarity]
    1. Describe the principles of memory management. [Familiarity]
    2. Explain the workings of a system with virtual memory management. [Familiarity]
    3. Compute Average Memory Access Time under a variety of cache and memory configurations and mixes of
    instruction and data references. [Usage]

## Storage systems and their technology

## Memory hierarchy: 

importance of temporal and spatial locality

## Main memory organization and operations

## Latency, cycle time, bandwidth, and interleaving

## Cache memories 

- address mapping, 
- block size, 
- replacement
- store policy

## Multiprocessor cache consistency

Using the memory system for inter-core synchronization/atomic memory operations

## Virtual memory 

(page table, TLB)

## Fault handling and reliability

## Error coding, data compression, and data integrity 

(cross-reference [SF/Reliability through Redundancy]())
