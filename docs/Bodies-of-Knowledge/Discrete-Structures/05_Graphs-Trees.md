# DS/Graphs and Trees

??? info "Learning Outcomes"

    1. Illustrate by example the basic terminology of graph theory, as well as some of the properties and special
    cases of each type of graph/tree. [Familiarity]
    2. Demonstrate different traversal methods for trees and graphs, including pre-, post-, and in-order traversal of
    trees. [Usage]
    3. Model a variety of real-world problems in computer science using appropriate forms of graphs and trees,
    such as representing a network topology or the organization of a hierarchical file system. [Usage]
    4. Show how concepts from graphs and trees appear in data structures, algorithms, proof techniques
    (structural induction), and counting. [Usage]
    5. Explain how to construct a spanning tree of a graph. [Usage]
    6. Determine if two graphs are isomorphic. [Usage]
