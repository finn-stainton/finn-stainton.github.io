??? info "Learning Outcomes"

    1. Calculate probabilities of events and expectations of random variables for elementary problems such as games of chance. [Usage]
    2. Differentiate between dependent and independent events. [Usage]
    3. Identify a case of the binomial distribution and compute a probability using that distribution. [Usage]
    4. Apply Bayes theorem to determine conditional probabilities in a problem. [Usage]
    5. Apply the tools of probability to solve problems such as the average case analysis of algorithms or analyzing hashing. [Usage]
    6. Compute the variance for a given probability distribution. [Usage]
    7. Explain how events that are independent can be conditionally dependent (and vice-versa).Identify real-world examples of such cases. [Usage]
