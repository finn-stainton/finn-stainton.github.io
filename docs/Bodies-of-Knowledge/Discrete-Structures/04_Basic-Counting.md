# DS/Basic of Counting

??? info "Learning Outcomes"

    1. Apply counting arguments, including sum and product rules, inclusion-exclusion principle and
    arithmetic/geometric progressions. [Usage]
    1. Apply the pigeonhole principle in the context of a formal proof. [Usage]
    2. Compute permutations and combinations of a set, and interpret the meaning in the context of the particular application. [Usage]
    3. Map real-world applications to appropriate counting formalisms, such as determining the number of ways to arrange people around a table, subject to constraints on the seating arrangement, or the number of ways to determine certain hands in cards (e.g., a full house). [Usage]
    4. Solve a variety of basic recurrence relations. [Usage]
    5. Analyze a problem to determine underlying recurrence relations. [Usage]
    6. Perform computations involving modular arithmetic. [Usage]
