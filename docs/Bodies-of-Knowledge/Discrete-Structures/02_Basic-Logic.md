??? info "Learning Outcomes"

    1. Convert logical statements from informal language to propositional and predicate logic expressions.
    [Usage]
    2. Apply formal methods of symbolic propositional and predicate logic, such as calculating validity of
    formulae and computing normal forms. [Usage]
    3. Use the rules of inference to construct proofs in propositional and predicate logic. [Usage]
    4. Describe how symbolic logic can be used to model real-life situations or applications, including those
    arising in computing contexts such as software analysis (e.g., program correctness), database queries, and
    algorithms. [Usage]
    5. Apply formal logic proofs and/or informal, but rigorous, logical reasoning to real problems, such as
    predicting the behavior of software or solving problems such as puzzles. [Usage]
    6. Describe the strengths and limitations of propositional and predicate logic. [Familiarity]

## Propositional logic 

(cross-reference: Propositional logic is also reviewed in IS/Knowledge Based Reasoning)

## Logical connectives

## Truth tables

## Normal forms 

(conjunctive and disjunctive)

## Validity of well-formed formula

## Propositional inference rules 

(concepts of modus ponens and modus tollens)

## Predicate logic

### Universal and existential quantification

## Limitations of propositional and predicate logic 

(e.g., expressiveness issues)
