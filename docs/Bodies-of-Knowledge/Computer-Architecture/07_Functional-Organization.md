    1. Compare alternative implementation of datapaths. [Familiarity]
    2. Discuss the concept of control points and the generation of control signals using hardwired or
    microprogrammed implementations. [Familiarity]
    1. Explain basic instruction level parallelism using pipelining and the major hazards that may occur. [Familiarity]
    2. Design and implement a complete processor, including datapath and control. [Usage]
    3. Determine, for a given processor and memory system implementation, the average cycles per instruction. [Assessment]
