# AR/Interfacing and Communication

??? info "Learning Outcomes"

    1. Explain how interrupts are used to implement I/O control and data transfers. [Familiarity]
    2. Identify various types of buses in a computer system. [Familiarity]
    3. Describe data access from a magnetic disk drive. [Familiarity]
    4. Compare common network organizations, such as ethernet/bus, ring, switched vs. routed. [Familiarity]
    5. Identify the cross-layer interfaces needed for multimedia access and presentation, from image fetch from remote storage, through transport over a communications network, to staging into local memory, and final presentation to a graphical display. [Familiarity]
    6. Describe the advantages and limitations of RAID architectures. [Familiarity]

## I/O fundamentals: 

- handshaking, 
- buffering, 
- programmed I/O,
