# AR/Digital Logic and Digital Systems

??? info "Learning Outcomes"

    1. Describe the progression of computer technology components from vacuum tubes to VLSI, from mainframe computer architectures to the organization of warehouse-scale computers. [Familiarity]
    2. Comprehend the trend of modern computer architectures towards multi-core and that parallelism is inherent in all hardware systems. [Familiarity]
    3. Explain the implications of the “power wall” in terms of further processor performance improvements and the drive towards harnessing parallelism. [Familiarity]
    4. Articulate that there are many equivalent representations of computer functionality, including logical expressions and gates, and be able to use mathematical expressions to describe the functions of simple combinational and sequential circuits. [Familiarity]
    5. Design the basic building blocks of a computer: arithmetic-logic unit (gate-level), registers (gate-level), central processing unit (register transfer-level), memory (register transfer-level). [Usage]
    6. Use CAD tools for capture, synthesis, and simulation to evaluate simple building blocks (e.g., arithmetic-logic unit, registers, movement between registers) of a simple computer design. [Usage]
    7. Evaluate the functional and timing diagram behavior of a simple processor implemented at the logic circuit level. [Assessment]

## Overview and history of computer architecture

## Combinational vs. sequential logic

/Field programmable gate arrays as a fundamental combinational + sequential logic building block

## Multiple representations/layers of interpretation

 (hardware is just another layer)

## Computer-aided design tools

 that process hardware and architectural representations

## Register transfer notation/Hardware Description Language 

(Verilog/VHDL)

## Physical constraints 

(gate delays, fan-in, fan-out, energy/power)
