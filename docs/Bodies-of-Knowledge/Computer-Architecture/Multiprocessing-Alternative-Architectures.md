# AR/Multiprocessing and Alternative Architectures

??? info "Learning Outcomes"

    1. Discuss the concept of parallel processing beyond the classical von Neumann model. [Familiarity]
    2. Describe alternative parallel architectures such as SIMD and MIMD. [Familiarity]
    3. Explain the concept of interconnection networks and characterize different approaches. [Familiarity]
    4. Discuss the special concerns that multiprocessing systems present with respect to memory management and describe how these are addressed. [Familiarity]
    5. Describe the differences between memory backplane, processor memory interconnect, and remote memory via networks, their implications for access latency and impact on program performance. [Familiarity]
