# NWK/ Performance evaluation

??? info "Learning Outcomes"

    - Describe performance metrics.
    - Contrast how different performance metrics affect a specific network and/or service paradigm.
    - Contrast service paradigms such as connection-oriented service and connectionless service.
    - Contrast network performance characteristics including latency and throughput.
    - Discuss network error sources such as dropped packets and corrupted data.
    - Define a “quality of experience” metric (QoE, QoX or simply QX), which is a measure of a customer's experiences with a service (e.g. web browsing, phone call, TV broadcast, call to a call center).
    - Apply fundamental modeling theory to analyze the performance of a network (e.g., a M/M/1 queue).

## Performance metrics

Contrast how different performance metrics affect a specific network and/or service paradigm.

## Service paradigms

### connection-oriented service

### Connectionless service

## Network performance characteristics

### latency

### throughput

## Network error sources

### dropped packets

### corrupted data

## “quality of experience” metrics

### QoE

### QoX

### simply QX

which is a measure of a customer's experiences with a service (e.g. web browsing, phone call, TV broadcast, call to a call center).

## Fundamental modeling theory

to analyze the performance of a network (e.g., a M/M/1 queue).
