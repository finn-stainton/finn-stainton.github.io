# Platform-Based Development (PBD) / Introduction

Platform-based development is concerned with the design and development of software applications that reside on specific software platforms. In contrast to general purpose programming, platform-based development takes into account platform-specific constraints. For instance web programming, multimedia development, mobile computing, app development, and robotics are examples of relevant platforms that provide specific services/APIs/hardware that constrain development. Such platforms are characterized by the use of specialized APIs, distinct delivery/update mechanisms, and being abstracted away from the machine level. Platform-based development may be applied over a wide breadth of ecosystems.
