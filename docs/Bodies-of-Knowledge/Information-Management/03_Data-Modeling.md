??? info "Learning outcomes"

    1. Compare and contrast appropriate data models, including internal structures, for different types of data.[Assessment]
    2. Describe concepts in modeling notation (e.g., Entity-Relation Diagrams or UML) and how they would be used. [Familiarity]
    3. Define the fundamental terminology used in the relational data model. [Familiarity]
    4. Describe the basic principles of the relational data model. [Familiarity]
    5. Apply the modeling concepts and notation of the relational data model. [Usage]
    6. Describe the main concepts of the OO model such as object identity, type constructors, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and versioning. [Familiarity]
    7. Describe the differences between relational and semi-structured data models. [Assessment]
    8. Give a semi-structured equivalent (e.g., in DTD or XML Schema) for a given relational schema. [Usage]

## Data modeling

## Conceptual models (e.g., entity-relationship, UML diagrams)

## Spreadsheet models

## Relational data models

## Object-oriented models (cross-reference PL/Object-Oriented Programming)

## Semi-structured data model (expressed using DTD or XML Schema, for example)
