    1. Compare and contrast different uses of data mining as evidenced in both research and application.[Assessment]
    2. Explain the value of finding associations in market basket data. [Familiarity]
    3. Characterize the kinds of patterns that can be discovered by association rule mining. [Assessment]
    4. Describe how to extend a relational system to find patterns using association rules. [Familiarity]
    5. Evaluate different methodologies for effective application of data mining. [Assessment]
    6. Identify and characterize sources of noise, redundancy, and outliers in presented data. [Assessment]
    7. Identify mechanisms (on-line aggregation, anytime behavior, interactive visualization) to close the loop in
    the data mining process. [Familiarity]
    1. Describe why the various close-the-loop processes improve the effectiveness of data mining. [Familiarity]
