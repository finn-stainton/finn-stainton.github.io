??? info "Learning outcomes"

    1. Prepare a relational schema from a conceptual model developed using the entity- relationship model. [Usage]
    2. Explain and demonstrate the concepts of entity integrity constraint and referential integrity constraint (including definition of the concept of a foreign key). [Usage]
    3. Demonstrate use of the relational algebra operations from mathematical set theory (union, intersection, difference, and Cartesian product) and the relational algebra operations developed specifically for relational databases (select (restrict), project, join, and division). [Usage]
    4. Write queries in the relational algebra. [Usage]
    5. Write queries in the tuple relational calculus. [Usage]
    6. Determine the functional dependency between two or more attributes that are a subset of a relation. [Assessment]
    7. Connect constraints expressed as primary key and foreign key, with functional dependencies. [Usage]
    8. Compute the closure of a set of attributes under given functional dependencies. [Usage]
    9. Determine whether a set of attributes form a superkey and/or candidate key for a relation with given functional dependencies. [Assessment]
    10. Evaluate a proposed decomposition, to say whether it has lossless-join and dependency-preservation. [Assessment]
    11. Describe the properties of BCNF, PJNF, 5NF. [Familiarity]
    12. Explain the impact of normalization on the efficiency of database operations especially query optimization. [Familiarity]
    13. Describe what is a multi-valued dependency and what type of constraints it specifies. [Familiarity]
