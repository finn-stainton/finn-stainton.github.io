# DIG/Design with programmable logic

??? info "Learning Outcomes"

    1. Describe basic elements of programmable logic such as lookup tables (LUTs), AND/OR plane programmable logic, programmable mux logic, and programmable routing.
    2. Discuss programmable logic architectures such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and Complex Programmable Logic Devices (CPLDs).
    3. Describe common features of programmable logic architectures such as hard macros (e.g., adders, multipliers, SRAMs), clock generation support (e.g., PLLs, multiple clock networks), and support for different logic standards.
    4. Implement a digital system in an FPGA or CPLD and describe and evaluate tradeoffs for implementation characteristics such as programmable logic resources that are used, maximum clock frequency, setup/hold times for external inputs, and clock-to-out delay.
    5. Describe advanced features of programmable logic architectures in the form of hard macros such as CPUs, high-speed serial transceivers, and support for other transceiver standards (e.g., PCI Express, Ethernet PCS).
