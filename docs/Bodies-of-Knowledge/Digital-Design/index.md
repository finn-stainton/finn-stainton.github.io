# Digital Design (DIG) / History and Overview

**Area Scope**

The knowledge units in this area collectively encompass the following:

1. Digital design basics: number representation, arithmetic operations, Boolean algebra, and their realization as basic logic circuits
2. Building blocks: combinational, sequential, memories, and elements for arithmetic operations
3. Hardware Description Languages (HDLs), digital circuit modeling, design tools, and tool flow
4. Programmable logic platforms (e.g., FPGAs) for implementing digital systems
5. Datapaths and control units composed of combinational and sequential building blocks
6. Analysis and design of digital systems including design space exploration, and tradeoffs based on constraints such as performance, power, and cost
