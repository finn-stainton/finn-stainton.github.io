# SGP/Sampling and Aliasing

??? "Learning Outcomes:"

    1. State the sampling theorem and the related concepts of the Nyquist frequency and aliasing.
    2. Demonstrate aliasing on a sampled sine wave.
    3. State the relationship between time and frequency domains with respect to sampling.
    4. Explain when spectra are discrete vs. continuous.
    5. Calculate the errors or noise generated by sampling and quantizing.
