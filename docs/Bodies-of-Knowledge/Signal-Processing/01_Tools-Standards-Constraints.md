??? "Learning Outcomes:"

    1. Describe the tradeoffs involved with increasing the sampling rate.
    2. Indicate key issues involved with sampling periodic signals including the sampling period.
    3. Indicate key issues involved with sampling non-periodic signals including spectral resolution.
    4. Prove whether a system is linear, time-invariant, causal, and/or stable given its input to output mapping.
    5. Derive non-recursive and recursive difference equations, as appropriate, given descriptions of input-output behavior for a linear, time-invariant system.
