??? info "Learning Outcomes:"

    1. Explain how the concept of impulse response arises from the combination of linearity and time-invariance.
    2. Derive the linear convolution summation from the definition of impulse response and linearity.
    3. Use the commutative property of convolution as a foundation for providing two explanations of how a system output depends on the input and system impulse response.
