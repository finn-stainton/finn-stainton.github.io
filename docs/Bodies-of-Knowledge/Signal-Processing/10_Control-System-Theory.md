# SGP/Control system theory and applications

??? "Learning Outcomes:"

    1. Define basic control system concepts (e.g., zero-state response, zero-input response, stability).
    2. Contrast design methods (root-locus, frequency-response, state-space) for control systems.
    3. Explain limitations and trade-offs associated with microcontroller implementations of digital control systems.
    4. Describe potential applications of digital control systems for electro-mechanical systems, including robotics.
    5. Implement a simple microcontroller-based motion control system with sensors and actuators
