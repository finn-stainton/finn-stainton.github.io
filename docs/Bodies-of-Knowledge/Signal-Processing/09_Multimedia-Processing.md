??? info "Learning Outcomes:"

    1. Define signals that vary in time and/or space and interpret frequencies in both domains.
    2. Describe how sampling affects image integrity.
    3. Explain how low-pass filtering tends to smooth images.
    4. Contrast between reconstruction and enhancement filters.
    5. Describe methods for minimizing image noise.
    6. Describe how digital techniques perceptually or otherwise enhance speech and audio signals.
    7. Explain techniques for noise reduction (e.g., Weiner or median filters) or cancellation (e.g., LMS filters) in audio processing.
    8. Explain the motivation for audio coding and state key elements of MPEG or related algorithms including perceptual elements.
