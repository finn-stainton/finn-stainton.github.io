# SGP/Frequency Response

??? "Learning Outcomes:"

    1. Interpret the frequency response of an LTI system as an alternative view from the impulse response.
    2. Analyze the frequency response of a system using the DTFT and the DFT.
    3. Determine pole and zero locations in the z-plane given a difference equation describing a system.
    4. Relate the frequency selectivity of filters to the z–transform domain system representation.
    5. Describe the repeated time series implication of frequency sampling.
