# ESY/Serial input and output

??? info "Learning Outcomes"

    1. Discuss the concepts of full-duplex and half-duplex communication.
    2. Contrast parallel I/O versus serial I/O tradeoffs in terms of throughput, wiring cost, and application.
    3. Describe the data formatting, timing diagrams, and signaling levels used in an asynchronous serial interface.
    4. Create programs that perform I/O to an external device or system that uses an asynchronous serial interface.
    5. Describe the data formatting, timing diagrams, and signaling levels used in a synchronous serial interface such as SPI or I2C.
    6. Create programs that perform I/O to an external device or system that uses a synchronous serial interface such as SPI or I2C.
