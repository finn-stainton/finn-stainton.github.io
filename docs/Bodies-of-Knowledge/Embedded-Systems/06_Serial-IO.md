??? info "Learning Outcomes"

    1. Discuss the concepts of full-duplex and half-duplex communication.
    2. Contrast parallel I/O versus serial I/O tradeoffs in terms of throughput, wiring cost, and application.
    3. Describe the data formatting, timing diagrams, and signaling levels used in an asynchronous serial interface.
    4. Create programs that perform I/O to an external device or system that uses an asynchronous serial interface.
    5. Describe the data formatting, timing diagrams, and signaling levels used in a synchronous serial interface such as SPI or I2C.
    6. Create programs that perform I/O to an external device or system that uses a synchronous serial interface such as SPI or I2C.

## Full-duplex and half-duplex communication

## Synchronous serial interface characteristics

### Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI)

#### Data formatting

#### Timing diagrams

#### signaling levels

### I2C

!!! quote ""
    Synchronous, multi-controller/multi-target, packet switched, single-ended, serial communication bus invented in 1982 by Philips Semiconductors. It is widely used for attaching lower-speed peripheral ICs to processors and microcontrollers.
