# ESY/Computing platforms for Embedded Systems

??? info "Learning Outcomes"

    1. Describe multimedia peripherals found in advanced embedded System-On-Chip implementations such video encoding, audio processing, display processing.
    2. Describe interconnect and networking options for SoCs, including Network-on-Chip architectures.
    3. Contrast performance, power, and flexibility tradeoffs for hard core versus software CPUs found in Field Programmable Gate Arrays.
    4. Describe embedded applications that benefit from a multi-core approach.
    5. Describe embedded applications that benefit from other types of processors for embedded systems: DSP processors, GPUs, heterogeneous SOCs (CPUs/accelerators), FPGA-based processor
