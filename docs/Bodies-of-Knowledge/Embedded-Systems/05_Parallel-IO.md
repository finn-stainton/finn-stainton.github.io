# ESY/Parallel input and output

??? info "Learning Outcomes"

    1. Describe the appropriateness of different I/O configurations (input, strong drive, weak pullup/pulldown, open-drain, tri-state) available in general purpose I/O (GPIO) for a given target application.
    2. Create programs that perform a set of input/output operations on one more GPIOs using a polled approach.
    3. Describe how interrupts are supported on the target embedded system(s).
    4. Create programs that perform a sequence of input/output operations on one more GPIOs using an interrupt-driven approach.
    5. Discuss mechanisms such as hardware and software FIFOs for buffering data streams.
    6. Discuss Direct Memory Access (DMA) and describe how it is supported on the target embedded system.
    7. Create programs that perform a sequence of input/output operations using DMA.
