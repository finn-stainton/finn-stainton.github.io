# ESY/Relevant tools, standards, and engineering constraints

??? info "Learning Outcomes"

    1. Use an integrated development environment (IDE) to write, compile and/or assemble, and debug a program (high-level or assembly language) for a target embedded system.
    2. Contrast instrumentation choices for diagnosing/understanding hardware aspects of embedded systems behavior.
    3. List several standards applicable to embedded such as signaling levels and serial communication protocols.
