# ESY/Characteristics of embedded systems

[:octicons-arrow-left-24: Return to base](/Bodies-of-Knowledge/Embedded-Systems)

??? info "Learning Outcomes"

    1. Contrast CPUs used for embedded systems versus those used for general purpose computing.
    2. Evaluate and rank tradeoffs such as cost, power, and performance for different embedded systems applications.
    3. Describe architectural features of the target embedded system(s) (register structure, memory architecture, CPU features, peripheral subsystems). 
    4. Contrast the different types of processors for embedded systems: CPU microcontrollers, DSP processors, GPUs, heterogeneous SOCs (CPUs/accelerators), FPGA-based processors.

## Embedded system CPUs versus general purpose computing CPUs.
