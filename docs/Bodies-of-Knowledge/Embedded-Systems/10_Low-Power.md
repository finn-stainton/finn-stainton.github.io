# ESY/Techniques for low-power operation

??? info "Learning Outcomes"

    1. Describe sources of energy consumption such as toggling, leakage and pin configurations used for minimizing power.
    2. Describe power saving approaches used in embedded system design and their corresponding performance/power tradeoffs such as sleep/hibernate modes, peripheral system enable/disable, and clock frequency management, and appropriate GPIO configurations during sleep/hibernate.
    3. Describe wakeup mechanisms such as watchdog timer, real time clock, and external interrupts.
    4. Write programs that demonstrate minimal energy usage in performing I/O tasks through use of sleep and/or hibernate modes.
    5. Compute system battery life for an embedded system platform given parameters such as battery capacity, current draw, wake time, sleep time, clock frequency.
