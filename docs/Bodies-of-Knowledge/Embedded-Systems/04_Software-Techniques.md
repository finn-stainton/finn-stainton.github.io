# ESY/Basic software techniques for embedded applications

[:octicons-arrow-left-24: Return to base](/Bodies-of-Knowledge/Embedded-Systems)

??? info "Learning Outcomes"

    1. Manually translate simple high-level language statements to equivalent assembly language.
    2. Describe the actions of compilation, assembly, linking in the program translation process.
    3. Describe actions taken by compiler-generated code after system reset but before user application execution.
    4. Describe memory assignments made by a compiler for global variables, local variables, subroutine parameters and dynamically allocated storage.
    5. Explain the basic loop-forever structure of an embedded program.
    6. Design simple programs for embedded system applications including some that include modular/hierarchical programming techniques such as subroutines and functions.
    7. Demonstrate debugging techniques for simple embedded application programs.

## Translation of high-level to assembly language

## Program translation process.

### Compilation

### Assembly

### Linking

## Actions of machine code after system reset

but before user application execution.

## Compiler memory assignments

 made by a compiler for global variables, local variables, subroutine parameters and dynamically allocated storage.

## Loop-forever Structure

## Simple programs

 including some that include modular/hierarchical programming techniques
such as subroutines and functions.

## Debugging techniques

for simple embedded application programs.
