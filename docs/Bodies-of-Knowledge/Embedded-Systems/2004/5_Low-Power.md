??? info "Learning Outcomes"

    1. Understand why low-power computing is important.
    2. Identify sources of energy consumption.
    3. Identify possible remedies for energy consumption at various levels of design abstraction.

## Sources of energy consumption: 

- toggling, 
- leakage
  
## Instruction-level strategies for power management: 

function unit management

## Memory system power consumption: 

- caches, 
- off-chip memory

## Power consumption with multiple processes

## System-level power management: 

- deterministic, 
- probabilistic methods
