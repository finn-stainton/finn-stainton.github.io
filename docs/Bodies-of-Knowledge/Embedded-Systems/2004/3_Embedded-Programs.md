# ESY/Embedded Programs 2004

??? info "Learning Outcomes"

    1. Understand how high-level language programs convert into executable code.
    2. Know the capabilities and limits of compilers.
    3. Comprehend basic representations of programs used to manipulate programs either in a compiler or by hand.

## The program translation process: 

- compilation, 
- assembly, 
- linking
  
## Representations of programs: 

- data flow
- control flow

## Fundamental concepts of assembly language and linking: 

- labels, 
- address management

## Compilation tasks: 

- mapping variables to memory, 
- managing data structures, 
- translating control structures, 
- translating expressions

## What can and cannot be controlled through the compiler; 

when writing assembly language makes sense
