# ESY/Advanced input/output issues

??? info "Learning Outcomes"

    1. Discuss concepts used in I/O buses such as master/slave devices, arbitration, transactions, priorities, and packets.
    2. Contrast single-ended signaling versus differential signaling for use in high-speed serial busses, and methods for measuring differential signaling quality such as eye-diagrams.
    3. Describe features such as topology, signaling levels, arbitration, speed, packet structure, and data transfers for one or more advanced serial bus protocols such as the Controller Area Network, Universal Serial Bus, and IEEE 1394 (FireWire).
    4. Discuss architectures and applications of persistent storage for embedded systems, such as flash drives, SD cards, and FRAM.
