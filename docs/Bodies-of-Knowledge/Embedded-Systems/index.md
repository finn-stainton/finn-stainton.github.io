---# Embedded Systems (ESY) / History and Overview

The knowledge units in this area collectively encompass the following:

1. Purpose and role of embedded systems in computer engineering, along with important tradeoffs in such areas as power, performance,
and cost
2. Embedded systems software design, either in assembly language or a high-level language or both, for typical embedded systems
applications using modern tools and approaches for development and debugging
3. Digital interfacing using both parallel and asynchronous/synchronous serial techniques incorporating typical on-chip modules as such as
general purpose I/O, timers, and serial communication modules (e.g., UART, SPI, I2C, and CAN)
4. Analog interfacing using analog-to-digital convertors connected to common sensor elements and digital-to-analog converters
connected to typical actuator elements
5. Mobile and wireless embedded systems using both short-range (e.g., Bluetooth, 802.15.4) and long-range (e.g., cellular, Ethernet) in
various interconnection architectures
