??? info "Learning Outcomes"

    1. Describe terms and properties relating to Analog-to-Digital Conversion (ADC) and Digital-to-Analog Conversion (DAC) such as sampling rate, reference voltage, conversion time, precision, range, and encoding method.
    2. Perform voltage to binary and binary to voltage numerical conversions given range, encoding method, and reference voltage parameters.
    3. Describe DAC and ADC architectural approaches such as resistor ladder, successive approximation, flash, and delta-sigma, and give tradeoffs such as conversion time and circuit complexity.
    4. Demonstrate numerical conversion from a physical quantity such as pressure, temperature, and acceleration to voltage or current given an example sensor and its characteristic equation or graph.
    5. Create programs that use one or more external sensors for monitoring physical properties.
    6. Demonstrate numerical conversion from voltage or current to a physical quantity such as linear/angular movement, sound, and light given an example actuator and its characteristic equation or lookup-up table.
    7. Create programs that use one or more actuators for effecting physical control by an embedded system.
    8. Design circuitry that transforms voltage level/current drive from/to external sensors/actuators to that required/provided by a target CPU.
