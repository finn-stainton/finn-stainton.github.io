# ESY/Mobile and networked embedded systems

??? info "Learning Outcomes"

    1. Describe the role of embedded systems in the ‘internet of things.’
    2. Discuss options for adding short-range wireless connectivity to an embedded system such as Bluetooth and 802.15.4 and tradeoffs relating to cost, power, throughput, and connectivity.
    3. Discuss options for adding long-range wireless connectivity to an embedded system such as cellular and Ethernet and tradeoffs relating to cost, power, throughput, and connectivity.
    4. Contrast hardware options for adding wireless connectivity to an embedded system such as external smart modules or software stack-plus-radio integrated circuits.
    5. Contrast connectivity architectures such as point-to-point, star, and mesh.
    6. Discuss security options for protecting wireless communication links.
