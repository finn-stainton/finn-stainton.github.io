# ESY/Implementation Strategies for Complex Embedded Systems

??? info "Learning Outcomes"

    1. Describe the need for structured approaches in writing complex embedded applications.
    2. Describe techniques used in event-driven state machine frameworks such as events, event queues, active objects, event processing, priority queues, and hierarchical state machines.
    3. Describe techniques used in real time operating systems (RTOS) such as message passing, preemptive versus cooperative scheduling, semaphores, queues, tasks, co-routines, and mutexes.
    4. Create programs using either a state machine framework or an RTOS (or both) for sample embedded system applications.
