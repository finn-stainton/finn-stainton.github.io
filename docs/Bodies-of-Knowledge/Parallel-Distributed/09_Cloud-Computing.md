??? info "Learning outcomes"

    1. Discuss the importance of elasticity and resource management in cloud computing. [Familiarity]
    2. Explain strategies to synchronize a common view of shared data across a collection of devices. [Familiarity]
    3. Explain the advantages and disadvantages of using virtualized infrastructure. [Familiarity]
    4. Deploy an application that uses cloud infrastructure for computing and/or data resources. [Usage]
    5. Appropriately partition an application between a client and resources. [Usage]
