??? info "Learning outcomes"

    1. Detect and correct a load imbalance. [Usage]
    2. Calculate the implications of Amdahl’s law for a particular parallel algorithm (cross-reference SF/Evaluation for Amdahl’s Law). [Usage]
    3. Describe how data distribution/layout can affect an algorithm’s communication costs. [Familiarity]
    4. Detect and correct an instance of false sharing. [Usage]
    5. Explain the impact of scheduling on parallel performance. [Familiarity]
    6. Explain performance impacts of data locality. [Familiarity]
    7. Explain the impact and trade-off related to power usage on parallel performance. [Familiarity]
