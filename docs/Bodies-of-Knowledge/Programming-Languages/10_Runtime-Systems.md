    1. Compare the benefits of different memory-management schemes, using concepts such as fragmentation, locality, and memory overhead. [Familiarity]
    2. Discuss benefits and limitations of automatic memory management. [Familiarity]
    3. Explain the use of metadata in run-time representations of objects and activation records, such as class, pointers, array lengths, return addresses, and frame pointers. [Familiarity]
    4. Discuss advantages, disadvantages, and difficulties of just-in-time and dynamic recompilation. [Familiarity]
    5. Identify the services provided by modern language run-time systems. [Familiarity]

### malloc/ free

### garbage collection (mark-sweep, copying, reference counting), 

### regions (also known as arenas or zones) Data layout for objects and activation records

## Just-in-time compilation and dynamic recompilation
