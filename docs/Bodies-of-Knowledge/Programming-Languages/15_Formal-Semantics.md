??? info "Learning outcomes"

    1. Give a formal semantics for a small language. [Usage]
    2. Write a lambda-calculus program and show its evaluation to a normal form. [Usage]
    3. Discuss the different approaches of operational, denotational, and axiomatic semantics. [Familiarity]
    4. Use induction to prove properties of all programs in a language. [Usage]
    5. Use induction to prove properties of all programs in a language that are well-typed according to a formally defined type system. [Usage]
    6. Use parametricity to establish the behavior of code given only its type. [Usage]
    7. Use formal semantics to build a formal model of a software system other than a programming language. [Usage]
