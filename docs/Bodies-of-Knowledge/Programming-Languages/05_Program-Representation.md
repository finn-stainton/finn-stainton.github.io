# PL/ Program Representation

??? info "Learning outcomes"

    1. Explain how programs that process other programs treat the other programs as their input data. [Familiarity]
    1. Describe an abstract syntax tree for a small language. [Usage]
    2. Describe the benefits of having program representations other than strings of source code. [Familiarity]
    3. Write a program to process some representation of code for some purpose, such as an interpreter, an expression optimizer, or a documentation generator. [Usage]

## interpreters

## compilers

## type-checkers

## documentation generators

## Abstract syntax trees

contrast with concrete syntax

## Data structures to represent code for execution, translation, or transmission
