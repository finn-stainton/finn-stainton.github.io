# PL/ Event-Driven and Reactive Programming

??? info "Learning outcomes"

    1. Write event handlers for use in reactive systems, such as GUIs. [Usage]
    2. Explain why an event-driven programming style is natural in domains where programs react to external events. [Familiarity]
    3. Describe an interactive system in terms of a model, a view, and a controller. [Familiarity]
