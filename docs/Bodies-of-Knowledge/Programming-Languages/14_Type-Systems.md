# PL/ Type Systems

??? info "Learning outcomes"

    1. Define a type system precisely and compositionally. [Usage]
    2. For various foundational type constructors, identify the values they describe and the invariants they enforce. [Familiarity]
    3. Precisely specify the invariants preserved by a sound type system. [Familiarity]
    4. Prove type safety for a simple language in terms of preservation and progress theorems. [Usage]
    5. Implement a unification-based type-inference algorithm for a simple language. [Usage]
    6. Explain how static overloading and associated resolution algorithms influence the dynamic behavior of programs. [Familiarity]

## Compositional type constructors

### Product types (for aggregates) 

### Sum types

- unions
- function types
- quantified types
- recursive types

## Type checking

## Type safety as preservation plus progress

## Type inference

## Static overloading
