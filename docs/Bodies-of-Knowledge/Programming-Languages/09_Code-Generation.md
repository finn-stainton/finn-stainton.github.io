    1. Identify all essential steps for automatically converting source code into assembly or other low-level languages. [Familiarity]
    2. Generate the low-level code for calling functions/methods in modern languages. [Usage]
    3. Discuss why separate compilation requires uniform calling conventions. [Familiarity]
    4. Discuss why separate compilation limits optimization because of unknown effects of calls. [Familiarity]
    5. Discuss opportunities for optimization introduced by naive translation and approaches for achieving optimization, such as instruction selection, instruction scheduling, register allocation, and peephole optimization. [Familiarity]
