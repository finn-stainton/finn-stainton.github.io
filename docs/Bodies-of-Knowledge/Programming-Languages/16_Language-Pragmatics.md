- Evaluation order, precedence, and associativity
- Eager vs. delayed evaluation
- Defining control and iteration constructs
- External calls and system libraries

??? info "Learning outcomes"

    1. Discuss the role of concepts such as orthogonality and well-chosen defaults in language design.
    [Familiarity]
    1. Use crisp and objective criteria for evaluating language-design decisions. [Usage]
    2. Give an example program whose result can differ under different rules for evaluation order, precedence, or associativity. [Usage]
    3. Show uses of delayed evaluation, such as user-defined control abstractions. [Familiarity]
    4. Discuss the need for allowing calls to external calls and system libraries and the consequences for language implementation. [Familiarity]
