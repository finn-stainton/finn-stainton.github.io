# PL/ Object-Oriented Programming

??? info "Learning outcomes"

    1. Design and implement a class. [Usage]
    2. Use subclassing to design simple class hierarchies that allow code to be reused for distinct subclasses. [Usage]
    3. Correctly reason about control flow in a program using dynamic dispatch. [Usage]
    4. Compare and contrast (1) the procedural/functional approach (defining a function for each operation with the function body providing a case for each data variant) and (2) the object-oriented approach (defining a class for each data variant with the class definition providing a method for each operation). Understand both as defining a matrix of operations and variants. [Assessment] This outcome also appears in PL/Functional Programming.
    5. Explain the relationship between object-oriented inheritance (code-sharing and overriding) and subtyping (the idea of a subtype being usable in a context that expects the supertype). [Familiarity]
    6. Use object-oriented encapsulation mechanisms such as interfaces and private members. [Usage]
    7. Define and use iterators and other operations on aggregates, including operations that take functions as arguments, in multiple programming languages, selecting the most natural idioms for each language. [Usage] This outcome also appears in PL/Functional Programming.

## Object-oriented design

### Decomposition into objects carrying state and having behavior

### Class-hierarchy design for modeling

## Definition of classes

### fields

### methods

### constructors

## Subclasses

## Inheritance

## Method overriding

## Dynamic dispatch

### Method-call

## Subtyping 

(cross-reference PL/Type Systems)

### Subtype polymorphism

implicit upcasts in typed languages

### Notion of behavioral replacement

subtypes acting like supertypes

### Relationship between subtyping and inheritance

## Object-oriented idioms for encapsulation

### Privacy and visibility of class members

### Interfaces revealing only method signatures

### Abstract base classes

## Use of

### Collection classes

### Iterators
