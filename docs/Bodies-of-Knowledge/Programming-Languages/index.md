# Programming Languages (PL)

Programming languages are the medium through which programmers precisely describe
concepts, formulate algorithms, and reason about solutions. In the course of a career, a computer
scientist will work with many different languages, separately or together. Software developers
must understand the programming models underlying different languages and make informed
design choices in languages supporting multiple complementary approaches. Computer
scientists will often need to learn new languages and programming constructs, and must
understand the principles underlying how programming language features are defined,
composed, and implemented. The effective use of programming languages, and appreciation of
their limitations, also requires a basic knowledge of programming language translation and static
program analysis, as well as run-time components such as memory management.
