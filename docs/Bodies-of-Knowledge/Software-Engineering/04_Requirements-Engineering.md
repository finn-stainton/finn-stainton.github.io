??? info "Learning Outcomes"

    1. List the key components of a use case or similar description of some behavior that is required for a system. [Familiarity]
    2. Describe how the requirements engineering process supports the elicitation and validation of behavioral requirements. [Familiarity]
    3. Interpret a given requirements model for a simple software system. [Familiarity]
    4. Describe the fundamental challenges of and common techniques used for requirements elicitation. [Familiarity]
    5. List the key components of a data model (e.g., class diagrams or ER diagrams). [Familiarity]
    6. Identify both functional and non-functional requirements in a given requirements specification for a software system. [Usage]
    7. Conduct a review of a set of software requirements to determine the quality of the requirements with respect to the characteristics of good requirements. [Usage]
    8. Apply key elements and common methods for elicitation and analysis to produce a set of software requirements for a medium-sized software system. [Usage]
    9. Compare the plan-driven and agile approaches to requirements specification and validation and describe the benefits and risks associated with each. [Familiarity]
    10.  Use a common, non-formal method to model and specify the requirements for a medium-size software system. [Usage]
    11.  Translate into natural language a software requirements specification (e.g., a software component contract) written in a formal specification language. [Usage]
    12.  Create a prototype of a software system to mitigate risk in requirements. [Usage]
    13.  Differentiate between forward and backward tracing and explain their roles in the requirements validation process. [Familiarity]
