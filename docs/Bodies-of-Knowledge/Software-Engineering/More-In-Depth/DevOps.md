# DevOps

"DevOps is a set of practices, tools, and a cultural philosophy that automate and integrate the processes between software development and IT teams. It emphasizes team empowerment, cross-team communication and collaboration, and technology automation." [*Atlassian*](https://www.atlassian.com/devops)

## DevOps Lifecycle

### Planning

- ideate, define, and describe features and capabilities
- track progress at low and high levels of granularity
- Creating backlogs, tracking bugs, managing [agile software development](agile.md) and visualising progress

### Development

- writing, testing, reviewing, and the integration of code
- building that code into build artifacts
- use highly productive tools, automate mundane and manual steps, and iterate in small increments through [automated testing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/devops/develop/shift-left-make-testing-fast-reliable) and [continuous integration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/devops/develop/what-is-continuous-integration)

### Integration

- [continuous delivery](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/devops/deliver/what-is-continuous-delivery)
- deploying and configuring the fully governed foundational infrastructure
- [Infrastructure as Code](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/devops/deliver/what-is-infrastructure-as-code) (IaC), [containers](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/container-service/), and [microservices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/devops/deliver/what-are-microservices).
- release management process with clear manual approval stages
- automated gates that move applications between stages
- scalable, repeatable, controlled, and [well-tested](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/devops/deliver/shift-right-test-production).

### Deployment

### Operations

- [maintaining, monitoring, and troubleshooting applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/devops/operate/what-is-monitoring) in production
- ensure system reliability, high availability, and [aim for zero downtime](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/devops/operate/operating-reliable-systems-with-devops)
- [reinforcing security and governance](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/devops/operate/security-in-devops)
- [safe deployment practices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/devops/operate/safe-deployment-practices)
- vigilance requires rich telemetry, actionable alerting, and full visibility

### Learning

## DevOps Tools

### CI/CD

### Test Automation

### Continuous feedback tools

### Pull Request Automation

- Helps build faster
- Add "gates" to check change for issues
- Pull Request
  - Code Review
    - Code Style
    - Architecture
    - Scaling
- Linting
- Feedback for non-technical people
- Automated
  - CI
  - Secutiry Scanning
  - Notification to Reviewer

Goal: Help developer change proposal get reviewed and merged within 24 hours of when they are made. 
  
### Deployment Automation

- Helps with ease of change

### Application Performance Management

- Automatic Health, Downtime, Rolebacks
