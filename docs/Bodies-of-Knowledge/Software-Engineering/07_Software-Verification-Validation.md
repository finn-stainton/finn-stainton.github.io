[:octicons-arrow-left-24: Return to base](/Bodies-of-Knowledge/Software-Engineering/)

??? info "Learning Outcomes"

    1. Distinguish between program validation and verification. [Familiarity]
    2. Describe the role that tools can play in the validation of software. [Familiarity]
    3. Undertake, as part of a team activity, an inspection of a medium-size code segment. [Usage]
    4. Describe and distinguish among the different types and levels of testing (unit, integration, systems, and
    acceptance). [Familiarity]
    1. Describe techniques for identifying significant test cases for integration, regression and system testing. [Familiarity]
    2. Create and document a set of tests for a medium-size code segment. [Usage]
    3. Describe how to select good regression tests and automate them. [Familiarity]
    4. Use a defect tracking tool to manage software defects in a small software project. [Usage]
    5. Discuss the limitations of testing in a particular domain. [Familiarity]
    6.  Evaluate a test suite for a medium-size code segment. [Usage]
    7.  Compare static and dynamic approaches to verification. [Familiarity]
    8.  Identify the fundamental principles of test-driven development methods and explain the role of automated testing in these methods. [Familiarity]
    9.  Discuss the issues involving the testing of object-oriented software. [Usage]
    10. Describe techniques for the verification and validation of non-code artifacts. [Familiarity]
    11. Describe approaches for fault estimation. [Familiarity]
    12. Estimate the number of faults in a small software application based on fault density and fault seeding. [Usage]
    13. Conduct an inspection or review of software source code for a small or medium sized software project. [Usage]

(cross-reference IAS/Secure Software Engineering)

## Testing fundamentals

(cross-reference [SDF/Development Methods](/Bodies-of-Knowledge/Software-Development-Fundamentals/04_Developement-Methods))

### Unit testing

### Integration testing

### Validation testing

### System testing

### Test plan creation and test case generation

### Black-box testing techniques

### White-box testing techniques

### Regression testing and test automation

## Defect tracking

## Limitations of testing in particular domains,

such as parallel or safety-critical systems

## Static approaches to verification

## Dynamic approaches to verification

## Test-driven development (TDD)

Test first development + Refactoring

**Red**: Write a little test and run it. Code fails (as there is none)

**Green**: Write code to make the test pass a quickly as possible

**Refactor**: Clean the code up to standard

Repeat

## Behaviour Driven Development (BDD)

## Validation planning

### documentation for validation

## Object-oriented testing;

### systems testing

- documentation,
- help files,
- training materials

## Fault logging, fault tracking and technical support for such activities

## Fault estimation and testing termination

### Defect seeding
