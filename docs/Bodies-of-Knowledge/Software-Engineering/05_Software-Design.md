??? info "Learning Outcomes"

    1. Articulate design principles including separation of concerns, information hiding, coupling and cohesion, and encapsulation. [Familiarity]
    2. Use a design paradigm to design a simple software system, and explain how system design principles have been applied in this design. [Usage]
    3. Construct models of the design of a simple software system that are appropriate for the paradigm used to design it. [Usage]
    4. Within the context of a single design paradigm, describe one or more design patterns that could be applicable to the design of a simple software system. [Familiarity]
    5. For a simple system suitable for a given scenario, discuss and select an appropriate design paradigm. [Usage]
    6. Create appropriate models for the structure and behavior of software products from their requirements specifications. [Usage]
    7. Explain the relationships between the requirements for a software product and its design, using appropriate models. [Assessment]
    8. For the design of a simple software system within the context of a single design paradigm, describe the software architecture of that system. [Familiarity]
    9. Given a high-level design, identify the software architecture by differentiating among common software architectures such as 3-tier, pipe-and-filter, and client-server. [Familiarity]
    10. Investigate the impact of software architectures selection on the design of a simple system. [Assessment]
    11. Apply simple examples of patterns in a software design. [Usage]
    12. Describe a form of refactoring and discuss when it may be applicable. [Familiarity]
    13. Select suitable components for use in the design of a software product. [Usage]
    14. Explain how suitable components might need to be adapted for use in the design of a software product. [Familiarity]
    15. Design a contract for a typical small software component for use in a given system. [Usage]
    16. Discuss and select appropriate software architecture for a simple system suitable for a given scenario. [Usage]
    17. Apply models for internal and external qualities in designing software components to achieve an acceptable tradeoff between conflicting quality aspects. [Usage]
    18. Analyze a software design from the perspective of a significant internal quality attribute. [Assessment]
    19. Analyze a software design from the perspective of a significant external quality attribute. [Assessment]
    20. Explain the role of objects in middleware systems and the relationship with components. [Familiarity]
    21. Apply component-oriented approaches to the design of a range of software, such as using components for concurrency and transactions, for reliable communication services, for database interaction including services for remote query and database management, or for secure communication and access. [Usage]
    22. Refactor an existing software implementation to improve some aspect of its design. [Usage]
    23. State and apply the principles of least privilege and fail-safe defaults. [Familiarity]

## System design principles: 

levels of abstraction (architectural design and detailed design), separation of
concerns, information hiding, coupling and cohesion, re-use of standard structures

## Design Paradigms 

structured design (top-down functional decomposition),
object-oriented analysis and design, 
event driven design, 
component-level design, 
data-structured centered, 
aspect oriented,
function oriented, 
service oriented

## Structural models

## Behavioral models
 
 of software designs

## Design patterns

## Relationships between requirements and designs: 

transformation of models, 

design of contracts, 

invariants

## Software architecture concepts and standard architectures 

client-server, 

n-layer, 

transform centered,

pipes-and-filters

## Refactoring designs using design patterns

## The use of components in design: 

component selection, 
design, 
adaptation
assembly of components, 
components and patterns, 
components and objects (for example, building a GUI using a standard widget set)

## Internal design qualities, and models for them:

efficiency and performance, 
redundancy and fault tolerance, 
traceability of requirements

## External design qualities, and models for them: 

functionality, 
reliability, 
performance and efficiency, 
usability, 
maintainability, 
portability

## Measurement and analysis of design quality

## Tradeoffs between different aspects of quality

## Application frameworks

## Middleware: 

the object-oriented paradigm within middleware, 
object request brokers and marshalling, 
transaction processing monitors,
workflow systems

## Principles of secure design and coding 

(cross-reference IAS/Principles of Secure Design)

### Principle of least privilege

### Principle of fail-safe defaults

### Principle of psychological acceptability
