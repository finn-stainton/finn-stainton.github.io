??? info "Learning Outcomes"

    1. Describe how software can interact with and participate in various systems including information management, embedded, process control, and communications systems. [Familiarity]
    2. Describe the relative advantages and disadvantages among several major process models (e.g., waterfall, iterative, and agile). [Familiarity]
    3. Describe the different practices that are key components of various process models. [Familiarity]
    4. Differentiate among the phases of software development. [Familiarity]
    5. Describe how programming in the large differs from individual efforts with respect to understanding a large code base, code reading, understanding builds, and understanding context of changes. [Familiarity]
    6. Explain the concept of a software lifecycle and provide an example, illustrating its phases including the deliverables that are produced. [Familiarity]
    7. Compare several common process models with respect to their value for development of particular classes of software systems taking into account issues such as requirement stability, size, and non-functional characteristics. [Usage]
    8. Define software quality and describe the role of quality assurance activities in the software process. [Familiarity]
    9. Describe the intent and fundamental similarities among process improvement approaches. [Familiarity]
    10. Compare several process improvement models such as CMM, CMMI, CQI, Plan-Do-Check-Act, or
    ISO9000. [Assessment]
    11. Assess a development effort and recommend potential changes by participating in process improvement (using a model such as PSP) or engaging in a project retrospective. [Usage]
    12. Explain the role of process maturity models in process improvement. [Familiarity]
    13. Describe several process metrics for assessing and controlling a project. [Familiarity]
    14. Use project metrics to describe the current state of a project. [Usage]
