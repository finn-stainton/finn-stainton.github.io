# Software Engineering (SE)

In every computing application domain, professionalism, quality, schedule, and cost are critical to producing software systems. Because of this, the elements of software engineering are applicable to developing software in all areas of computing. A wide variety of software engineering practices have been developed and utilized since the need for a discipline of software engineering was first recognized. Many trade-offs between these different practices have also been identified. Practicing software engineers have to select and apply appropriate techniques and practices to a given development effort in order to maximize value. To learn how to do so, they study the elements of software engineering.

Software engineering is the discipline concerned with the application of theory, knowledge, and practice to effectively and efficiently build reliable software systems that satisfy the requirements of customers and users. This discipline is applicable to small, medium, and large-scale systems. It encompasses all phases of the lifecycle of a software system, including requirements elicitation, analysis and specification; design; construction; verification and validation; deployment; and operation and maintenance. Whether small or large, following a traditional plan-driven development process, an agile approach, or some other method, software engineering is concerned with the best way to build good software systems.

Software engineering uses engineering methods, processes, techniques, and measurements. It
benefits from the use of tools for managing software development; analyzing and modeling
software artifacts; assessing and controlling quality; and for ensuring a disciplined, controlled
approach to software evolution and reuse. The software engineering toolbox has evolved over the
years. For instance, the use of contracts, with requires and ensure clauses and class invariants, is
one good practice that has become more common. Software development, which can involve an
individual developer or a team or teams of developers, requires choosing the most appropriate
tools, methods, and approaches for a given development environment.
