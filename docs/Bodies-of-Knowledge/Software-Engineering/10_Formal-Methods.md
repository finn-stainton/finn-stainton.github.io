??? info "Learning Outcomes"

    1. Describe the role formal specification and analysis techniques can play in the development of complex software and compare their use as validation and verification techniques with testing. [Familiarity]
    2. Apply formal specification and analysis techniques to software designs and programs with low complexity. [Usage]
    3. Explain the potential benefits and drawbacks of using formal specification languages. [Familiarity]
    4. Create and evaluate program assertions for a variety of behaviors ranging from simple through complex. [Usage]
    5. Using a common formal specification language, formulate the specification of a simple software system and derive examples of test cases from the specification. [Usage]
