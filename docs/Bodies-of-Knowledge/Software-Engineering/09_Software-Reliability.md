??? info "Learning Outcomes"

    1. Explain the problems that exist in achieving very high levels of reliability. [Familiarity]
    2. Describe how software reliability contributes to system reliability. [Familiarity]
    3. List approaches to minimizing faults that can be applied at each stage of the software lifecycle. [Familiarity]
    4. Compare the characteristics of three different reliability modeling approaches. [Familiarity]
    5. Demonstrate the ability to apply multiple methods to develop reliability estimates for a software system. [Usage]
    6. Identify methods that will lead to the realization of a software architecture that achieves a specified level of reliability. [Usage]
    7. Identify ways to apply redundancy to achieve fault tolerance for a medium-sized application. [Usage]
