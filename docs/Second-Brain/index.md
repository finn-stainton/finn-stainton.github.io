# Second Brain

This is a collection of my learnings and discoveries from subjects I am interested in. It is aimed as a personal wiki/ knowledge base and is not intended to be a primary source. The best way to find content is to use the search bar above.

!!! warning  "FYI"

    Content in the Second Brain lags behind my current knowledge. Entries in the Second Brain may be incomplete, non-existent (currently) or they don't cover all material on a subject matter. An empty entry shows my intention of learning/ writing 
    about a subject.
