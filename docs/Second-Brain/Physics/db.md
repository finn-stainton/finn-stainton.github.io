# DeciBel(dB)

Is a base 10 logarithmic scale used for comparing two physical quantities. A deci-Bel is a tenth of a Bel and is abbreviated as dB with the 'B' being capitalised to indicate Bel as the base unit.

$$
N_{dB} = 10 \log_{10} ({{Q_2} \over {Q_1}})
$$

Where:

- $N_{dB}$ is the ratio of the two quantities, expressed in deciBels
- $Q_2$ is the output quantity
- $Q_1$ is the input quantity
